Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164 (1st Cir.  2016).  In finding that the scope of the Compliance Monitoring provision against Fanning was overbroad, the First Circuit noted that, as conceded by the Commission itself, such a provision would “ostensibly require Fanning to report if he was a waiter at a restaurant.”  Id. at 177.  Such burdensome and illogical reporting unrelated to any legitimate regulatory purposes and intended to harass, annoy, and invade the privacy rights of Fanning would indeed be required under the Complaint Counsel’s proposal to reissue the Compliance Monitoring sanction on remand without limiting its scope.  {K0677241.1}Moreover, the Compliance Monitoring provision is not a reasonably related to the violations as required by law.  Complaint Counsel states that to “monitor order compliance and prevent recidivism” the Commission routinely issues injunctive orders requiring violators to notify the agency of new business affiliations.  The legal authority relied upon by Complaint Counsel does not justify the argument.  Complaint Counsel cites to district court injunctive orders, including in FTC v. Wellness Support Network, Inc., No. 10-cv-04879, 2014 WL 644749 (N.D. Cal. 2014), for the proposition that federal district courts “also routinely include such provisions in injunctive orders for violations of the FTC Act.”  However, the First Circuit rejected previously such legal authority cited in support of the entry of blanket compliance monitoring order against Fanning, including the analysis in Wellness, stating: Of the cited cases, only FTC v. Wellness Support Network, Inc. contains an explanation for the compliance reporting requirements. The defendants in that case made misleading representations about diabetes products over the course of eight years. Wellness Support, 2014 WL 644749, at *2. The district court concluded that lengthy monitoring was necessary because the defendants had been “personally involved in serious violations of the FTC Act over a period of many years.” Id. at *22. The district court simply states that the Commission must know the defendant's business affiliation ""in order. . . to monitor Defendants' compliance."" Id. We do not find this bare analysis persuasive. Fanning, 821 F.3d at 177, n. 10 (emphasis added).   Complaint Counsel again posits “bare analysis” that cannot prevail, as a matter of law. The proposed revised order does not bear a “reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist” and thus runs afoul of the law to include the First Circuit’s remand order.  See Id. at 175 (“We may interfere with a Commission order if ‘the remedy selected bears no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist’”) (quoting Removatron Int'l Corp. v. FTC, 884 F.2d 1489, 1499 (1st Cir.1989)). {K0677241.1}2Complaint Counsel cannot justify the unlawful remedial order by invoking a “the risk of recidivism” in general fashion.  Complaint Counsel’s opinion that Fanning may likely reoffend is wholly speculative and devoid of any factual basis.  Assuming the validity of the Commission’s Order, which Fanning continues to contest as unlawful, Fanning never previously “offended” and has not “offended” since the issuance of the original order over three (3) years ago.  Also, recidivism is defined as, “[a] tendency to relapse into a habit of criminal activity or behavior”, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).  Thus, there must be a causal connection between anticipated behavior and some prior conduct.  Here, the issues pertain specifically to one reputational and social media website – jerk.com – and the alleged misrepresentation of the source of content appearing on this website.  If possible relapse justifies regulatory intervention, any required reporting must be accordingly limited in scope to business affiliations or employment in which Fanning could feasibly engage in the same or similar conduct of misrepresenting the source of content on a reputational and social media website targeting  individual consumers.  The Commission does not enjoy and Compliant Counsel cannot press unlimited “fencing in” authority.   Respectfully submitted,  JOHN FANNING, By his attorney, /s/ Peter F. Carr, II Peter F.

Fanning incorporates by reference the arguments set forth in his Briefing on Remand. Complaint Counsel’s proposal to modify the Final Order’s Compliance Monitoring provision for Fanning from ten (10) to five (5) years without narrowing the provision’s scope contravenes the remand order of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (“First Circuit”) in Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164 (1st Cir. 2016).   In finding that the scope of the Compliance Monitoring provision against Fanning was overbroad, the First Circuit noted that, as conceded by the Commission itself, such a provision would “ostensibly require Fanning to report if he was a waiter at a restaurant.”  Id. at 177.  Such burdensome and illogical reporting would indeed be required of Fanning under the Complaint Counsel’s proposal to reissue the Compliance Monitoring sanction on remand without limiting its scope.  Moreover, the legal authority cited by Complaint Counsel ostensibly providing an “adequate explanation” for why the Compliance Monitoring provision is reasonably related to Fanning’s alleged violations is unpersuasive.  Complaint Counsel states that to “monitor order compliance and prevent recidivism” the Commission routinely issues injunctive orders requiring violators to notify the agency of new business affiliations.  Complaint Counsel further cites to district court injunctive orders, including FTC v. Wellness Support Network, Inc., No. 10-cv-04879, 2014 WL 644749 (N.D. Cal. 2014), for the proposition that federal district courts “also routinely include such provisions in injunctive orders for violations of the FTC Act.”  However, the First Circuit specifically addressed the Commission’s supporting legal authority in its Opinion, including the analysis in Wellness: Of the cited cases, only FTC v. Wellness Support Network, Inc. contains an explanation for the compliance reporting requirements. The defendants in that case made misleading representations about diabetes products over the course of eight years. Wellness Support, 2014 WL 644749, at *2. The district court concluded that lengthy monitoring was necessary because the defendants had been “personally involved in serious violations of the FTC Act over a period of many years.” Id. at *22. The district court simply states that the Commission must know the defendant's business affiliation ""in order. . . to monitor Defendants' compliance."" Id. We do not find this bare analysis persuasive. Fanning, 821 F.3d at 177, n. 10 (emphasis added).   By simply restating the same rationale on remand that the First Circuit considered and summarily rejected, Complaint Counsel fails to demonstrate that the remedy bears a “reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist”, and thus runs afoul of the First Circuit’s remand order.  See Id. at 175 (“We may interfere with a Commission order if ‘the remedy selected bears 2 no reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist’”) (quoting Removatron Int'l Corp. v.FTC, 884 F.2d 1489, 1499 (1st Cir.1989)).Further, Complaint Counsel’s invocation of “the risk of recidivism” as a justification for the overbroad scope of the Compliance Monitoring provision is similarly unpersuasive.  By its definition, recidivism, “[a] tendency to relapse into a habit of criminal activity or behavior”, Recidivism, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014), requires a connection between anticipated behavior and some prior conduct.  The issues in this proceeding pertain specifically to one reputational and social media website – jerk.com – and alleged misrepresentation of the source of content appearing on this website.  Pursuant to Complaint Counsel’s recidivism theory, any required reporting should be accordingly limited in scope to business affiliations or employment in which Fanning could feasibly engage in the same or similar conduct – misrepresenting the source of content on a reputational and social media website.   Fanning thus reasserts his proposal that, if the Commission refuses to strike the Compliance Monitoring provision in its entirety, Paragraph VI should be revised to read as follows: VI. COMPLIANCE MONITORING – JOHN FANNING IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent John Fanning, for a period of ten (10) three (3) years after the date of issuance of this order, shall notify the Commission of the discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of his affiliation with any new business or employment that may affect compliance obligations arising under this order. The notice shall include respondent’s new business address and telephone number and a description of the nature of the business or employment and his duties and responsibilities. 3 4 Respectfully submitted,  JOHN FANNING, By his attorney, /s/ Peter F.

Kirsch  II  Chicago  IL  fur Defendant   MEMORANDUM OPINION   RICHARD D. BENNETT  District Judge.   '*1  Tbe  Federal  Trade  Commission  (""FTC"")  brought  this  case  under  sections  5(a)  and  13(b)  of the  Federal  Trade  Commission Act  (""FTC  Act"")   15  U.S.C.  §§  45(a)  and  53(b )   against  a  group  of  corporate  entities  and  individuals  for  alleged  deceptive  conduct  in  coz:nection  with  the  sale  of software.  Specifically   the  FTC  alleged  that two companies  Defendants Innovative Marketing  Inc.  (''Innnvative Marketing"") and ByteHosting Internet Services   LLC (""ByteHosting"") operated as a  common enterprise (the  ""IMI  Enterprise""  or  ""Enterprise')  to  conduct  a  massive  ""scareware"" 1  scheme that marketed a variety of computer  security software via deceptive advertising. The FTC alleged  that  several  of  the  companies'  officers  and  directors   namely  Sam Jain (""Jain"")  Daniel Sundin (""Sundin"")  Marc  D'Souza (""D'Souza"")  Kristy Ross (""Ross"")  and James Reno  (""Reno"")  directed or participated in the 1MI Enterprise.   The FTC filed the present action on December 2  2008. After  a hearing was held on December 12  2008  this Court entered  a  Preliminary Injunction  that served to   inter alia   prohibit   Defendants from  continuing the alleged  deceptive business  activities  freeze Defendants' assets  and compel Defendants  to tum over certain business records to the FTC.   Of the  original  eight  defendants   four  have  settled  with  the FTC   and three are in default  and  have had judgments  entered against them for failure  to  appear and participate in  this  litigation. Defendant Kristy Ross is the only remaining  defendant  and the sole remaining motion  the FTC's Motion  for  SUIIIIIl8{)' Judgment   pertains  to her alone.  On May  9   2012  this  Court  held a  bearin.g  on  that  motion  pursuant  to  Local Rule  105.6  (D.Md.2011). 2  For the  reasons  that  follow  the Federal Trade Commission's Motion for Summary  Judgment (ECF No. 186) Is DENIED  and a bench trial has  been scheduled for September 10  2012.   BACKGROUND   The  background  facts  of this  case  were  fully  set  forth  in this  Court's  previous Memorandum  Opinion  entered on  September  16   2009.  See  Federal  Trade  Commission  v.  lnn(Jllative Marketing  Inc.   654 F.Supp.2d 378 (D.Md.2009)  (ECF Nos.  138  &  139). That background is repeated  here   in part  so as  to provide context for the pending motion for  summary judgment.   The FTC's Complaint sets forth a host of factual allegations   general  and  specific   concerning  misconduct  committed  by  the  corporate  defendants   Innovative  Marketing   and  Bytebosting   and  the  individual  defendants   Reno   Jain   Sundin   Ross   and  Marc  and  Maurice  D'Souza.  The  Complaint alleges  that since at  least 2003   the Defendants  conspired  to sell  computer  security  software  by means  of  deceptive Internet advertising. More specifically  Defendants  allegedly  issued  exploitive  advertisements  that redirected  consumers 10 sites that falsely  claimed that the consumers'  computers  had  been  scanned  and  that  certain  viruses   pornographic  pictures   or  compromised  files  had  been  discovered. The consumers  were then directed  to purchase  computer security software in order to purge their computers  1:lf the suspect files  purportedly detected by the Defendants'  fake scans.   *2  The  Complaint also alleges that since 2004  or earlier   Defendants had placed misleading advertisements for their  software products with major Internet advertising networks   which  serve  as  brokers  that  distribute  advertisements  to  their  website partners.

Ross  Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)  2012-2 Trade Cases P 78 075   with their partners to display the Defendants' advertisements  across  the  Internet.  After  the  advertising  networks   such  as  MyGeek   began  to  receive  complaints   they  stopped  accepting  Defendants1  advertisements.  At  this  point   in  2007   Defendants  allegedly  began  creating  a  number  of  sham  Internet  advertising  agencies  that  duped  advertising  networks  and  commercial  websites  into  accepting  their  misleading  advertisements.  Toward  this  end   Defendants  falsely  represented  that  they  were  authorized  to  place  advertisements  and they used sophisticated program coding  that concealed the  exploitative nature  of the  ads  from the  advertising networks to  gain  their approval for distribution.  Once distributed and placed upon popular Internet sites  the  exploitative content of the  ads was revealed to many of the  consumers  who were thereupon redirected to the Defendants'  websites  that operated 1b.e  bogus  scans.  The  FTC  alleges  that this scheme resulted in substantial consumer injury  and  that more than one million  consumers  were  deceived  into  purchasing the Defendants' software products.   Defendant  Kristy  Ross  does  not  directly  contradict  these  assertions  made  by  the  FTC  and  does  not  argue  that  Innovative Marketing or the other named defendants did not  violate the FTC Act through unfair and deceptive advertising  and marketing. Instead  her opposition to the FTC's motion  centers on her role in the company-specifically  she argues  that she was merely an employee and not a ""control person""  at the company  that she did not have the requisite knowledge  of the misconduct at issue   and as a result   cannot be held  individually liable under the Act. In this regard  the specific  allegations  concerning Ross'  control and  knowledge of  the  company's conduct will be discussed in the Analysis section  infra.   STANDARD OF REVIEW     .  ..   ....

As Ross does not contest much  of the FTC's evidence regarding the other defendants' alleged  violations of the FTC Act   this  Court will assume arguendo  that FTC Act violations did indeed occur and will concentrate  on the parties'  arguments  pertaining  to  Ross'  involvement  with Innovative Marketing.   *4  As a prelim.inacy matter  it must be noted that the FTC  has clearly been able to compile a substantial and impressive  amount of evidence  in this  case.  Because tills  case  is  set  for  a bench  trial   tills  Court will be the  finder  of fact   and  will  in all1ikelihood  review much the same evidence and  argument at trial Given this  it would appear that the expense  of further  litigation  could  be  avoided  through  summary  judgment However  this Court's role in evaluating evidence  in the  context  of summary judgment is markedly  different  than in the context of a bench trial.

Regarding  the Canadian Litigation documents cited extensively by the  FTC  Ross argues that  those same affidavits and pleadings  conclusively  show  that  she  was  not  a  control  person  or  director  at  Innovative  Marketing.  For  example   Daniel  Sundin's  affidavit in the Canadian Litigation indicates  that  Sundin  and  Sam  Jain  alone  were  the  principals  of  the  Innovative Marketing venture  and make no mention of Ross  being a partner or director of the company.

She argues  that the  FTC's  evidence  pertaining  to  her  corporate  titles  with Innovative Marketing is essentially meaningless insofar  as Innovative Marketing  did not  operate under traditional  corporate  formalities   and  the  titles  given  to  employees  were  used  only  to  explain  employees'  responsibilities  to  overseas  employees.  ld.

STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONERS ORSON SWINDLE AND  THOMAS B. LEARY   CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART   in ReverseAuction.com  Inc.  File No. 0023046   ReverseAuction.com  Inc.  a company that offers auction services on the Internet  became  a member of eBay  a popular Internet auction site  and was thereby granted access to the  e-mail addresses  eBay user IDs  and feedback ratings of other eBay members. When  registering as a member  ReverseAuction agreed to abide by eBais privacy agreement   whlch prohlbits members from using the personal identifying information of any eBay  member obtained through eBay's web site for the purpose of sending unsolicited  commercial e-mail. In Count One of the complaint  the Commission alleges that  ReverseAuction violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by using other eBay members' user  IDs  feedback ratings  and e-mail addresses for the purpose of sending those members  unsolicited commercial e-mail  in contravention of its agreement with eBay. The  complaint pleads alternative theories in support of the Section 5 violation in Count One:  that ReverseAucti.on engaged in deception by falsely representing to eBay that it would  abide by the privacy agreement  Complaint+ 16; or thatReverseAuction's use ofthe  eBay member information for the purposes of sending unsolicited commercial e-mail was  an unfair practice. Complaint + 1 7.   We join our colleagues in support of the deception theozy in Count I. ReverseAuction  represented to eBay that it would not use the infonnation it obtained about other members  to send unsolicited commercial e-mail. ReverseAuction  however  sent unsolicited e-mails  promoting its auction site to eBay members using e-mail addresses harvested from eBay's  site. ReverseAuction thereby deceived eBay directly and  in doing so  also misled other  members of the eBay community who believed that all participants in the eBay  marketplace would abide by the same privacy rules.   We recognize that the Commission's decision to proceed against the deception alleged in  Count One could be construed as placing the Commission in the position of enforcing  cBay's privacy policy. Nevertheless  we want to emphasize that our decision to challenge  ReverseAuction's deception is an effort to buttress  not supplant or detract from  initiatives  of private parties (like eBay) who develop and implement their own privacy  arrangements. We further believe that it is in the public interest for the Commission to  pursue the deception allegation in Count One because such deceptive conduct undermines  consumer confidence in the nascent electronic marketplace at a critical point in time and  may thereby inhibit its development.   We do not  however  support the unfairness theory in Count One. The Commission has no  authority to declare an act or practice unfair l lil}ess it ''causes or is likely to cause  substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers  themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to  competition."" 15 U.S.C. + 45(n) (emphasis added). The statutory requirement of   1 of2   11/3/2014 9:17AM   ReverseAuction.com  Inc. - STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONERS...   http://w'WV>'.ftc.gov/sitesfdefaultlfiles/documents/cases/2000/01/v.rww ...   substantial injury is actually derived from the Commission's own Statement of Policy   issued in 1980. The Comm.ission explained at that time that  ""[t]he Commission is not  concerned with trivial or merely speculative harms. In most oases a substantial injury  involves monetary harm ... Unwarranted health and safety risks may also support a  finding of unfairness. Emotional impact and other more subjective types of harm  on the  other hand  will not ordinarily make a practice unfair."" Letter from the Commission to the  Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and  Transportation  Commission Statement of Policy on the Scope of Consumer Unfairness  Jurisdiction  4 Trade Reg. Rep.(CCH) + 13 203 (Dec. 17  1980)  reprinted in  International Harvester   Inc.  104F.T.C. 949  1070-76 (1984).   We do not say that privacy concerns can never support an unfairness claim. In this case   however  RevrerseAuction's use of eBay members' information to send them e-mail did not  cause substantial enough injury to meet the statutory standard.   Consumers do not have a substantial privacy interest in the e-mail addresses and other  information that ReverseAuction harvested since consumers had already agreed to make  this information available to millions of other eBay members (albeit with restrictions on  using it for commercial solicitations). Moreover  a substantial portion of this information  is available without restriction to non-members who visit eBay's web site. Merely  obtaining consumers' e-mail addresses without their explicit consent and sending them  e-mail solicitations does not cause substantial injury.   The injury in this case was caused by deception: that is  by ReverseAuction's failure io  honor its express commitments. It is not necessary or appropriate to plead a less precise  theory.   Industry self-regulation and consumer preferences~ as expressed in the marketplace  are  the best and most efficient ways to formulate privacy arrangements on the Internet and in  commerce generally. Because p:oliferation of the kind of deceptive conduct in which  ReverseAuction allegedly engaged could undemrine consumer confidence in such privacy  arrangements  we believe that it is appropriate to pursue this matter under a deception  theory. The unfairness theory~ however  posits substantial injury stemming from  ReverseAuction's use of information readily available to millions of eBay members to  send commercial e-mail. This standard for substantial injury overstates the appropriate  level of government-enforced privacy protection on the Internet  and provides no rationale  for when unsolicited commercial e-mail is unfair and when it is not. We are troubled by  the possibility of an expansive and unwarrante-d use of the unfairness doctrine.   For the reasons discussed above  we dissent fr{)m the unfairness allegation contained in  Paragraph 17 of the Complaint.   2 of2   11/3/2014 9:17AM"
