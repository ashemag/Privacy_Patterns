ORDER SCHEDULING BRIEFING ON REMAND 

On May 9, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued an 

 
opinion affirming “the Commission’s entry of summary decision as to liability [in this 
proceeding] and all provisions of its remedial order except for compliance monitoring as to 
Fanning.”  Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164, 177-78 (1st Cir. 2016).  The 
court vacated and remanded that single portion of the Commission’s order for further 
proceedings consistent with the court’s opinion.  Id. at 178.  The court’s judgment was entered 
on May 9, 2016; on January 9, 2017, the Supreme Court denied Mr. Fanning’s petition for a writ 
of certiorari; and the time period for filing a petition for rehearing ended on February 3, 2017 
with no such petition having been filed.  This proceeding is therefore now pending before the 
Commission on remand.1 
 

 

                                                 
1 On August 23, 2016, the Commission issued an Order Scheduling Briefing On Remand in this matter, based on the 
understanding that Mr. Fanning had neither filed a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc with the Court of 
Appeals nor filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.  However, Mr. Fanning subsequently 
advised the Commission that he had attempted to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court; that 
his petition had been returned to him for failure to comply with the Rules of the Supreme Court; and that the Clerk 
of Court subsequently granted him an additional sixty days within which to file a corrected petition.  The 
Commission therefore vacated the briefing schedule in the August 23 Order.  Order Modifying August 23, 2016

The court’s remand applies to a single paragraph of the Commission’s Final Order issued 

 
on March 13, 2015.  Paragraph VI of that Order reads, in relevant part: 
 

VI. 

COMPLIANCE MONITORING – JOHN FANNING 

 

 

 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent John Fanning, for a period 

 
 
of ten (10) years after the date of issuance of this order, shall notify the 
Commission of the discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of 
his affiliation with any new business or employment.  The notice shall include 
respondent’s new business address and telephone number and a description of the 
nature of the business or employment and his duties and responsibilities. 
 

The court of appeals stated that this provision requires Mr. Fanning to “notify the Commission of 
all business affiliations and employment – regardless of whether or not the affiliate or employer 
has responsibilities relating to the order.”  Fanning, 821 F.3d at 177.  It explained that, 
“[w]ithout any guidance from the Commission, we cannot find these provisions are reasonably 
related to Fanning’s violation.”  Id. at 177.   
 
 
would assist it in resolving the issue presented on remand.  Such briefing shall be confined solely 
to that issue remanded by the court of appeals; that is, the compliance monitoring applicable to 
Mr. Fanning addressed in Paragraph VI of the Commission’s Final Order.  Accordingly,  
 

The Commission has determined that briefing by Mr. Fanning and Complaint Counsel 

IT IS ORDERED THAT: 

1.   On or before March 20, 2017, Mr. Fanning shall file a brief, not to exceed 2,000 

words, addressing the foregoing issue regarding Paragraph VI of the Commission’s 
Final Order and including proposed alternative language for Paragraph VI; 

 
2.  On or before fourteen days after service of Mr. Fanning’s brief, Complaint Counsel 

may file an answering brief not to exceed 2,000 words; and 

 
3.  On or before five days after service of Complaint Counsel’s answering brief, 

Mr. Fanning may file a reply brief not to exceed 1,250 words. 

 

 

 
 

By the Commission.
