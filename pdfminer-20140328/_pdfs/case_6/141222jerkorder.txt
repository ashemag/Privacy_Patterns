Docket No. 9361 

 

 

 

ORDER EXTENDING THE TIME FOR JERK, LLC TO RESPOND TO 

THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY DECISION AND RESCHEDULING THE 

EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE 

Jerk argues that it fully participated in this case until July 2014, when its prior attorney 

 
On September 29, 2014, Complaint Counsel moved for summary decision on the claims 
 
against Respondents Jerk, LLC (“Jerk”) and John Fanning.  The Commission extended the time 
for Respondents to oppose the Motion for Summary Decision to November 4, and Mr. Fanning 
opposed the motion but Jerk did not.  On November 12, Complaint Counsel filed a reply, and 
Mr. Fanning filed a surreply on November 19.  Subsequently, on December 8, Jerk reappeared 
and filed a “Motion to Extend the Time to Respond to Motion for Summary Decision, and to 
Reschedule the Evidentiary Hearing.”  Complaint Counsel has opposed this motion. 
 
 
terminated her representation.  Jerk asserts that it had difficulty finding another attorney and was 
unrepresented until December 2, 2014, when it retained new counsel.  Jerk Mot. at 2.  Jerk 
contends that the Commission should vacate any findings or admissions entered against it by 
default and allow it to respond to the Motion for Summary Decision on the merits.  Specifically, 
Jerk seeks to:  (1) extend the deadline for its opposition to Complaint Counsel’s Motion for 
Summary Decision to a date on or after January 26, 2015; (2) postpone the Commission’s 
decision until after Jerk’s response; and (3) reschedule the evidentiary hearing before the 
Administrative Law Judge to a date on or after March 2, 2015.  In the alternative, Jerk requests 
ten days to respond to Complaint Counsel’s Motion for Summary Decision without changing the 
date of the evidentiary hearing.  Id. at 1-2, n.2.  Jerk argues that no party would be unduly 
prejudiced by a changed schedule because it no longer operates jerk.com or any other website; 
thus, there would be no detriment to consumers or the public.  Id. at 3. 

Complaint Counsel opposes Jerk’s motion, contending that Jerk offers no valid reason for 

 
 
its delay.  Opp. at 3-5.  Complaint Counsel observes that Jerk “effectively disappeared from the 
case for the majority of the discovery period, ignoring multiple deadlines, motions, and orders, 
including Chief Judge Chappell’s express warning that ‘Jerk remains a party in this case and is 
not entitled to ignore a discovery motion.’”  Id. at 4.  In addition, Complaint Counsel argues that 
it will be prejudiced because it will be forced to respond to Jerk’s opposition without the benefit 
of discovery.  Id. at 5-6.  Complaint Counsel also asserts that permitting delay would thwart the 
Commission’s preference for expeditious administrative litigation.  Id. at 6-7.   
 

 
 

 
 

As Complaint Counsel observes, no party has sought to reopen discovery in this case.  

Jerk’s failure to respond to discovery requests and other obligations cannot be excused 
simply because it had a difficult time finding legal representation.  However, the consequences 
of denying leave to file an opposition to the Motion for Summary Decision in this matter would 
be extraordinarily severe.  In addition, we are cognizant of the preference for having disputes 
resolved on their merits, and believe the circumstances here justify granting a limited time for 
Jerk to file a response.  Accordingly, to ensure that the Commission may fully consider the 
merits of this matter, we grant Jerk, LLC until January 5, 2015 to respond to Complaint 
Counsel’s Motion for Summary Decision.1  Because this will necessarily delay a decision on the 
motion, the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge is resecheduled to begin on March 23, 
2015.   
 
 
Opp. at 6.  Nonetheless, Complaint Counsel has rightly questioned the fairness of having to 
address Jerk’s opposition after Jerk was entirely unresponsive during the discovery period.  Id.  
We agree that Jerk should not be permitted to ignore its discovery obligations, particularly in 
light of Judge Chappell’s numerous orders compelling interrogatory responses, production of 
documents, and appearance for depositions.  Such discovery issues are properly addressed by the 
ALJ upon motions by the parties.  In addition, the Administrative Law Judge may issue a revised 
scheduling order to account for the rescheduled hearing date. 
 
 
 
 
Counsel’s Motion for Summary Decision on or before January 5, 2015; and 
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge 
 
of the Federal Trade Commission on the charges set forth in the Complaint will begin on March 
23, 2015. 
 
 
By the Commission.

1 We note that our ruling is limited to Jerk.com and should not be interpreted as an invitation for Mr. Fanning to file 
additional submissions.  He has already filed an opposition and surreply to Complaint Counsel’s Motion for 
Summary Decision.   

IT IS ORDERED THAT Respondent Jerk, LLC may file its response to Complaint 

Accordingly,
