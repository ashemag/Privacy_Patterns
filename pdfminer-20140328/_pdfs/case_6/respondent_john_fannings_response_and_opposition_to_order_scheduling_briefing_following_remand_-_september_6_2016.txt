{K0648909.1}UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION )In the matter of: ) )Jerk, LLC, a limited liability company, ) DOCKET NO. 9361 ) Also d/b/a JERK.COM, and ) ) PUBLIC John Fanning, ) Individually and as a member of )  Jerk, LLC, ) ) Respondents. ) )RESPONDENT JOHN FANNING’S RESPONSE AND OPPOSITION TO ORDER SCHEDULING BRIEFING FOLLOWING REMAND Respondent John Fanning (“Fanning”) hereby responds to the Federal Trade Commission’s (the “Commission”) August 23, 2016 “Order Scheduling Briefing on Remand” (the “Briefing Order”).  The Commission’s efforts to end-run the decision and order of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit must be rejected.  The Briefing Order requiring a brief pertaining to “the compliance monitoring applicable to Mr. Fanning addressed in Paragraph VI of the Commission’s Final Order” . . . “including proposed order language”  violates the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164 (1st Cir. 2016).  The First Circuit struck as unlawful the Commission’s Compliance Monitoring provision at Paragraph VI requiring Fanning, for a period of ten (10) years, to notify the Commission of “the discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of his affiliation with any new business or employment” including addresses, telephone numbers, and a description of the nature of the  {K0648909.1} 2  business or employment and Fanning’s duties and responsibilities.  The First Circuit invalidated this provision in its entirety: Without any guidance from the Commission, we cannot find these [compliance monitoring] provisions are reasonably related to Fanning's violation. As a result, we conclude the Commission's order, in this respect, must be vacated and remanded.  Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d at 177.  The First Circuit rejected the Commission’s explanation that “it has traditionally required such reporting” and discounted the cases cited by the Commission purportedly containing similar provisions, noting that “the orders, however, are not only less onerous than the one imposed on Fanning, but also almost entirely bereft of analysis that might explain the rationale for such a requirement.”  Id.    The Briefing Order is tantamount to contempt by the Commission of the First Circuit’s order.  The First Circuit did not invite the Commission to revise its Compliance Monitoring portion of the Final Order.  The First Circuit voided Paragraph VI, remanded the case, and ordered the Commission to enter a revised Final Order without Paragraph VI of the original Final Order.  Paragraph VI of the Commission’s Final Order should be stricken in its entirety and excised from a revised Final Order consistent with the First Circuit’s ruling.  In the event the Commission continues to press an interpretation of the First Circuit’s opinion and remand order whereby the Commission intends to rewrite instead of delete Paragraph VI of the Final Order, the Commission must first obtain clarification from the First Circuit given the clear analysis and the unambiguous ruling by the First Circuit.  The Commission should not just ignore and flout the First Circuit’s order.  Moreover, the Commission’s justification for further briefing that “no petition for rehearing or for certiorari” was filed is inaccurate.  Fanning filed a timely Petition for Writ of Certiorari (“Petition”) to the Supreme Court of the United States on August 8, 2016, and  {K0648909.1} 3  provided notice and a copy of the Petition to the Solicitor General.  Due to nonconformity with certain Supreme Court formatting requirements, the Supreme Court provided Fanning 60 days within which to submit a conforming Petition pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 14.5.  (See Attached Order).  Fanning plans to submit a timely conforming Petition.  If the First Circuit rules on a motion for clarification that it remanded with the intent to permit the Commission a chance to rewrite Paragraph IV instead of to strike it in its entirety and the Petition is denied, Fanning reserves the right at that point to address revised proposed language with respect to Compliance Monitoring.  Until that time and until such orders, any further briefing is premature, unwarranted, and a derogation of due process.
