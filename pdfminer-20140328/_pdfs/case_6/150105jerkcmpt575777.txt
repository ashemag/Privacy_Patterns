RESPONDENT JERK, LLC' S RESPONSE TO THE COURT'S 

ORDER OF DECEMBER 22, 2014 

Respondent Jerk, LLC (hereinafter "Jerk") submits the following in response to the 

Court's Order ofDecember 22, 2014, as modified by the Court's Order of December 30,2014. 

Prior counsel for Jerk, Maria Crimi Speth, withdrew from her representation of Jerk in July 2014. 

She was notified that she would be subpoenaed and was,  in fact, deposed in October 2014. 

Although Ms. Speth asserted the attorney-client privilege and attorney-client confidentiality in 

response to many questions at her deposition, the fact that she was subjected to a deposition 

would make many attorneys less likely to take on Jerk's representation. 

Jerk understands the discovery obligations imposed by the Commission's Rules of 

Practice and the Court's prior orders.  Jerk has conferred with counsel for the other parties and is 

working with them to submit, imminently and hopefully today, a joint scheduling motion with an 

agreed-upon schedule for all aspects of this matter going forward.  Because this proposed 

schedule will include deadlines for Jerk's responses to outstanding interrogatories, document 

requests, and depositions, no purpose would be served by setting out such a schedule separately. 

Jerk anticipates that the proposed schedule will  call for Jerk's interrogatory and document

responses to be due January 13,2015.  Jerk requests that its responses to the Requests for 

Admission also be due that day. 

WHEREFORE, Jerk respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant Jerk's Motion 

to Extend Time to Answer Complaint Counsel's Second Request for Admissions, and extend the 

time to respond to that request to and including January 13, 2015. 

Dated: January 5, 2015
