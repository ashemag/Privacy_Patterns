ORDER REVISING BRIEFING SCHEDULE ON REMAND 

On March 3, 2017, the Commission issued an Order Scheduling Briefing on Remand 

 
following entry of judgment by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denying 
Respondent John Fanning’s petition for review in this proceeding, and denial by the Supreme 
Court of Mr. Fanning’s petition for a writ of certiorari.  The March 3 Order noted that the Court 
of Appeals had affirmed “the Commission’s entry of summary decision as to liability [in this 
proceeding] and all provisions of its remedial order except for compliance monitoring as to 
Fanning.”  Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164, 177-78 (1st Cir. 2016).  The 
court vacated and remanded only that portion of the Commission’s order for further proceedings 
consistent with the court’s opinion.  Id. at 178. 
 
 
on March 13, 2015.  Paragraph VI of that Order reads, in relevant part: 
 

The court’s remand applies to a single paragraph of the Commission’s Final Order issued 

 

 

VI. 

 

COMPLIANCE MONITORING – JOHN FANNING 

 

 

 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent John Fanning, for a period 

 
 
of ten (10) years after the date of issuance of this order, shall notify the 
Commission of the discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of 
his affiliation with any new business or employment.  The notice shall include 
respondent’s new business address and telephone number and a description of the 
nature of the business or employment and his duties and responsibilities. 
 

The court of appeals stated that this provision requires Mr. Fanning to “notify the Commission of 
all business affiliations and employment – regardless of whether or not the affiliate or employer 
has responsibilities relating to the order.”  Fanning, 821 F.3d at 177.  It explained that, 
“[w]ithout any guidance from the Commission, we cannot find these provisions are reasonably 
related to Fanning’s violation.”  Id. at 177.   

The Commission determined that briefing by Mr. Fanning and Complaint Counsel would 

 
assist it in resolving the issue presented on remand.  In the March 3 Order, the Commission 
therefore ordered that briefs be filed, beginning with an opening brief from Mr. Fanning that was 
to be filed on or before March 20, 2017. 
 
 
On March 17, 2017, Mr. Fanning filed a Motion for Clarification with the court of 
appeals.  In that motion, Mr. Fanning argued that that court’s order and judgment “does not 
permit the FTC another opportunity to formulate a new Compliance Monitoring sanction.”  He 
requested that the court clarify its opinion and judgment “to express that the Federal Trade 
Commission on remand shall strike in its entirety Paragraph VI-Compliance Monitoring from the 
revised final administrative order. . . .”  On March 20, 2017, Mr. Fanning filed a motion with the 
Commission asking for a stay of the briefing schedule pending the appellate court’s ruling on the 
Motion for Clarification.    
 
 
Motion for Clarification.  The court explained, “The reconsideration of compliance monitoring 
provisions is permissibly within the scope of the remand.”  In light of this order, Mr. Fanning’s 
motion for stay is moot.  On March 22, 2017, Mr. Fanning filed a Motion to enlarge the March 3 
Order briefing schedule.  On April 12, 2017, Mr. Fanning filed a Response to the March 3 Order 
in which he restates his position that the Court of Appeals had precluded imposition of a new 
Compliance Monitoring provision and provides his views regarding the content of such a 
provision if the FTC declines to strike it in its entirety.  
 

On March 21, 2017, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied Mr. Fanning’s 

The Commission has determined to accept Mr. Fanning’s April 12 filing as his opening 

brief and to revise the remainder of the briefing schedule.  Accordingly,  
 

IT IS ORDERED THAT: 

 

 1.       The Motion of John Fanning to Stay and Continue Remand Proceedings Pending 

Ruling on Motion for Clarification is DENIED as moot; 

2.      The Unopposed Motion of Respondent John Fanning to Enlarge the Time to File 

Brief is GRANTED IN PART, and Respondent John Fanning’s Response to 
Order Scheduling Briefing Following Remand is accepted as Mr. Fanning’s 
opening brief; 

3.   On or before May 5, 2017, Complaint Counsel may file an answering brief not to 

exceed 2,000 words; and 

 
4.  On or before five days after service of Complaint Counsel’s answering brief, 

Mr. Fanning may file a reply brief not to exceed 1,250 words. 

 

 

 

By the Commission.
