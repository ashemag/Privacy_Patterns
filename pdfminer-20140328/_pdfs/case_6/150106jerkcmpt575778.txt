COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO 

REPLY TO RESPONDENT JERK, LLC'S OPPOSITION TO 

MOTION FOR SUMMARY DECISION 

Complaint Counsel hereby respectfully request an extension of four days to file a Reply 

to the Opposition of Respondent Jerk, LLC ("Jerk") to Complaint Counsel's Motion for 

Summary Decision ("MSD").  Jerk filed their opposition on January 5, 2015.  Under Rule 

3.22(d), Complaint Counsel's Reply to Jerk's Opposition is currently due on January 12. 

Complaint Counsel seek an additional four days, until January 16, to  file their Reply. 

I. 

ARGUMENT 
A.  Legal Standard. 

Commission Rules provide that "the Commission, for good cause shown, may extend any 

time limit prescribed by the rules in this chapter or by order of the Commission or an 

Administrative Law Judge .... "  16 C.P.R. ยง 4.3(b).  The Federal Rules similarly prescribe the 

PUBLIC 

"good cause" standard.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).  An extension of time under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) is 

appropriate when there is no showing of bad faith or that an extension would prejudice the 

opposing party.  Ahanchian v. Xenon Pictures, Inc.,  624 F.3d 1253, 1260 (9th Cir. 2010). 

B.  A Four-Day Extension Is Appropriate. 

Good cause exists for granting Complaint Counsel's request for a four-day extension to 

reply to Jerk's Opposition.  First, Complaint Counsel require additional time to respond to new 

arguments raised for the fust time in Jerk's Opposition, including the impact of the 

Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. ยง 230(c)(l), on the Complaint' s allegations, as well as 

Jerk's contention that summary decision should be entered in its favor.  Second, Complaint 

Counsel find themselves pressed for time in having to reply to Jerk' s Opposition at the same time 

as responding to Jerk's Response to the Administrative Law Judge 's Order of December 22, 

2014 ("Jerk's Response"), which was also filed yesterday with Chief Administrative Law Judge 

Chappell.  Finally, this extension would permit the parties to receive Jerk's responses to 

Complaint Counsel's long outstanding interrogatories and document requests in advance of 

Complaint Counsel's Reply.  Jerk' s counsel has represented to Complaint Counsel that Jerk will 

be able to provide these responses on or before January 13. 1 

An extension of four days would not prejudice opposing counsel since counsel for Jerk 

and Fanning do not oppose this request.  This proceedings also will not be negatively affected by 

this brief delay, as the Commission has recently moved the evidentiary hearing date to March 23, 

2015. 

Unfortunately, the requested extension will not afford the opportunity to obtain Jerk's 

deposition testimony before Complaint Counsel' s Reply, since Jerk's representative(s) still need 
to be designated and will not be deposed until the end of January.  In the interest of expediency, 
Complaint Counsel do not wish to delay this proceeding any further by seeking a month-long 
extension for the Reply. 

2 

PUBLIC 

Finally, this request for an extension is made in good faith.  Complaint Counsel have 

sought the extension promptly, a day after Jerk filed its opposition, and have not otherwise 

engaged in unnecessary delays or dilatory conduct in the prosecution of this action.  In fact, this 

would be the first extension granted to Complaint Counsel in this entire proceeding. 

II. 

CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, Complaint Counsel respectfully requests that the Commission 

grant this unopposed motion to extend the deadline to reply to Jerk's Opposition to the MSD to 

January 16, 2015.
