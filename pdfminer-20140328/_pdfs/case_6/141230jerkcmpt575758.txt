NON-PARTY STRIPE, INC.'S MOTION FOR IN CAMERA TREATMENT 

Pursuant to Rule 3.45 of the Federal Trade Commission's Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R 

§ 3.45(b), non-party Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe") respectfully moves this Court for in camera treatment 

oftwo competitively-sensitive, confidential business documents (the "Confidential Documents"). 

Stripe produced these documents, among others, in response to a third-party subpoena and civil 

investigative demand in this matter.  The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has now notified 

Stripe that it intends to introduce six of Stripe's documents, including the Confidential 

Documents, into evidence at the administrative trial in this matter.  See Letter from the Federal 

Trade Commission dated October 15, 2014 (attached as Exhibit A). 

The FTC notified Stripe that intends to seek permanent in camera treatment for five of 

the six Stripe documents, including the Confidential Documents, which contain sensitive 

financial or personal information.1  The Confidential Documents, however, warrant additional 

protection from public disclosure given the sensitive business information and trade secrets they 

contain.  Thus, Stripe submits this Motion requesting permanent in camera treatment of the 

1 The FTC filed it motion on December 23, 2014 and seeks permanent in camera treatment for five Stripe 
documents CX0421 -CX0425.  Stripe joins the FTC's request for in camera treatment of the personally identifiable 
information and/or consumer or financial information contained in these documents.

Confidential Documents in their entirety. 

All ofthe materials for which Stripe is seeking in camera treatment are confidential 

business documents, such that if they were to become part of the public record, Stripe would be 

significantly harmed in its ability to compete in the payments processing industry.  For the 

reasons discussed in this motion, Stripe requests that this Court afford its confidential business 

docunlents in camera treatment indefinitely. In support of this motion, Stripe relies on the 

Affidavit of Jon Zieger ("Zieger Declaration"), attached as Exhibit B, which provides additional 

details on the documents for which Stripe is seeking in camera treatment.

II. 

Stripes Documents are Secret and Material such that Disclosure Would Result in 
Serious Injury to Stripe 

In camera treatment of material is appropriate when its "public disclosure will likely 

result in a clearly defined, serious injury to the person, partnership, or corporation requesting" 

such treatment.  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b).  The proponent demonstrates serious competitive injury by 

showing that the documents are secret and that they are material to the business.  In re General 

Foods Corp., 95 F.T.C. 352, 355 (1980); In re Dura Lube Corp., 1999 F.T.C. LEXIS 255, *5 

(1999).  In this context, courts generally attempt "to protect confidential business information 

from unnecessary airing."  HP. Hood & Sons, Inc.,  58 F.T.C. 1184, 1188 (1961). 

DWT 25568394vl 0095740-000002 

2 

PUBLIC-REDACTED 

In considering both secrecy and materiality, the Court may consider:  (1) the extent to 

which the information is known outside of the business;  (2) the extent to which it is known by 

employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken to guard the 

secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to the business and its competitors; 

(5) the amount of effort or money expended in developing the infonnation; and (6) the ease or 

difficulty with which the infonnation could be acquired or duplicated by others.  In re Bristol(cid:173)

Myers Co. , 90 F.T.C. 455, 456-457 (1977) 

The Confidential Documents are both secret and material to Stripe's business as 

discussed in detail in the Zieger Declaration.  In sum, the materials at issue contain information 

of competitive significance to Stripe, such as underwriting data and analysis as well as intemal 

risk assessments of its merchant-customers and applications of proprietary systems and 

processes.  Zieger Declaration at ~~5 -6.  As a payments processor, Stripe depends on its ability to 

evaluate underwriting and risk management prior to engaging its merchant-customers and thus, 

requires intemal evaluations and processes to assess the risk of any such relationships.  Id.  at ~5. 

Thus, it has developed intemal processes to assess risk for which it has spent significant 

resources and that are reflected in its dashboards.  Id. at~ 5-6.  Such information and processes 

are proprietary to Stripe and not publicly known outside of Stripe.  !d.  In addition, the risk of 

fraud and harm to its users from the public disclosure of Stripe's internal risk management and 

underwriting processes is likely.  !d.  Indeed, when Stripe produced the Confidential Documents, 

it took steps to maintain confidentiality by designating the documents "Confidential" and 

produced them for "attorney's eyes only" pursuant to the Protective Order in this case.  Because 

of the highly confidential and proprietary nature of the information and its materiality to Stripe's 

business, in camera treatment is appropriate. 

DWT 25568394v l  0095740-000002

PUBLIC-REDACTED 

Further, disclosure of the Confidential Documents will result in the loss of a business 

advantage to  Stripe.  See In re Dura Lube Corp., 1999 FTC LEXIS 255 at *7 (Dec. 23, 1999) 

("The likely loss of business advantages is a good example of a 'clearly defined, serious 

injury."').  The Confidential Documents are material to Stripe's internal underwriting and risk 

assessments that it applies in order to compete with other payments processors.  Zieger 

Declaration at ~~5-6.  Making such documents public would result in a loss of business 

advantage that Stripe has built as the result of its own substantial investments in the development 

of its proprietary systems and technical processes. 

Finally,  Stripe's status as a third party is relevant to the treatment of its documents.  The 

FTC has held that " [t]here can be no question that the confidential records of businesses involved 

in Commission proceedings should be protected insofar as possible."  HP. Hood &  Sons,  58 

F.T.C. at 1186.  This is especially so in the case of a third-party, which deserves "special 

solicitude" in its request for in camera treatment for its confidential business information.  See In 

re Kaiser Aluminum &  Chern.  Corp.,  103 FTC 500, 500 (1984) ("As a policy matter, extensions 

of confidential or in camera treatment in appropriate cases involving third party bystanders 

encourages cooperation with future adjudicative discovery requests.").  Stripe's third-party status 

therefore weighs in favor of granting in camera status to the Confidential Documents. 

III. 

The Confidential Documents Contain Trade Secrets, which will Remain Sensitive 
Over Time and Thus, Permanent In Camera Treatment is Justified 

Given the highly sensitive and technical nature of the information contained in the 

Confidential Documents, Stripe requests that they be given in camera treatment indefinitely? 

The trade secret infonnation contained in the Confidential Documents "is likely to remain 

2  Stripe seeks the same length of time for in camera treatment - permanent - as the FTC is seeking in its own motion 
for in camera treatment of Stripe' s documents.  To the extent such pennanent treatment is not given, Stripe requests 
that the period of in camera treatment of the Confidential Documents be no less than 10 years. 

DWT 25568394v l  0095740-000002

sensitive or become more sensitive with the passage oftime" such that the need for 

confidentiality is not likely to decrease over time.  In re Dura Lube Corp. , 1999 FTC LEXIS at 

*7-8.  "Trade secrets"- such as secret formulas and secret technical information- are granted 

more protection than ordinary business documents.  !d. at *5.  Here, as described in the Zieger 

Declaration, the Confidential Documents contain business and trade secrets in the form of 

internal Stripe dashboards, that apply secret formulas and technical processes in connection with 

Stripe' s underwriting and risk assessments that are critical to its ability to offer payments 

processing services.  Zieger Declaration at W 5-7.  The competitive significance of the technical 

formulas and criteria is unlikely to decrease over time and thus, indefinite protection from public 

disclosure is appropriate.  !d. at 1f 7. 

IV.  Conclusion 

For the reasons set forth above and in the accompanying Zieger Declaration, Stripe 

respectfully requests that this Court grant permanent in camera treatment for the Confidential 

Documents in their entirety.

DECLARATION OF JON ZIEGER IN SUPPORT OF NON-PARTY STRIPE, INC.'S 

MOTION FOR IN CAMERA TREATMENT 

I, Jon Zieger, hereby declare as follows: 

1. 

I am the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Stripe, Inc.  ("Stripe").  I 

make this declaration in support ofNon-Party Stripe, Inc.'s Motion for In Camera Treatment 

(the "Motion").  I have personal knowledge of the matters stated herein and, if called upon to do 

so, could competently testify about them. 

2. 

I have reviewed and am familiar with the documents Stripe produced in the 

above-captioned matter in response to a subpoena and civil investigative demand from the 

Federal Trade Commission.  I provided a certification of authenticity as to the produced 

documents, including the documents that are the subject of the Motion.  Given my position at 

Stripe, I am familiar with the type of information contained in the documents at issue and its 

competitive significance to Stripe.  Based on my review of the documents, my knowledge of 

Stripe's business, and my familiarity with the confidentiality protection afforded this type of 

information by Stripe, I submit that the disclosure of these documents to the public and to 

competitors of Stripe would cause serious competitive injury to Stripe. 

DWT 25569789vl 0095740-000002 

3. 

Stripe is a payments processor that provides its customers with a platform on 

which to accept payments online and in mobile apps.  Stripe processes billions of dollars a year 

for thousands of businesses, from newly launched start-ups to Fortune 500 companies.  In order 

to provide these payment services to its customers, Stripe collects and monitors various data, 

including bank and credit card account numbers, tax identification numbers, emails and other 

related financial information necessary to process payments.  Stripe also applies proprietary and 

confidential underwriting and risk management methods and formulas in order to service its 

customers.  Stripe often reviews this information in its internal dashboard applications.  Such 

methods and applications distinguish Stripe's business model from its competitors and are 

critical to its business development and competition strategies. 

4. 

The FTC has informed Stripe that it intends to use six of the documents that 

Stripe produced in response to a subpoena at the administrative hearing in this matter.  Of these 

documents, CX0421  and CX0422 are particularly sensitive and contain confidential business 

information and trade secrets.  As described in the Motion, Stripe seeks permanent in camera 

protection ofthe following documents:

5. 

CX0421  is a snapshot of Stripe's internal underwriting dashboard, which reflects 

the underwriting and risk analysis of merchants who apply to do business with Stripe.  CX0421 

also contains confidential information about Stripe's personnel and how they evaluate the 

customer applications.  Stripe keeps this information in strict confidence because it would be 

DWT 25569789vl 0095740-000002 

2 

harmful to Stripe's ability to analyze the underwriting risk of potential merchant-customers if 

how Stripe determines whether to approve an application is publicly disclosed.  Stripe has 

devoted significant resources to developing the underwriting and risk methodologies and 

technical formulas represented in CX0421.  As a payments processor, Stripe depends on its 

relationships with its customers as well as its ability to evaluate underwriting and risk 

management prior to engaging such relationships.  Thus, it would not only harm Stripe's ability 

to compete with other payments processors if its risk methodology was disclosed, but it also 

would harm consumers if potential merchant-customers fraudulently obtained and misused the 

information.  Stripe does not make its internal dashboard and the information it contains 

available to its  competitors or customers and Stripe does not share this information with non(cid:173)

Stripe personnel in the ordinary course ofbusiness. 

6. 

Similarly, CX0422 is a printout of Stripe's account dashboard, which contains 

information about consumer transactions for a particular merchant account.  Disclosure of 

CX0422 would reveal what systems Stripe uses to process the accounts and charges as well has 

how underwriters at Stripe review risk and make assessments.  Stripe has devoted significant 

resources developing its proprietary processes and technical systems or formulas underlying and 

reflected in CX0422, which represent substantial competitive value to Stripe.  This information 

is not publicly available and Stripe has devoted its resources to protecting the confidentiality of 

the information in CX0422.  Thus, disclosure of CX0422 would harm Stripe's ability to compete 

by making its proprietary business systems public.  In addition, Stripe seeks to avoid public 

disclosure of its risk assessment methodology and criteria because of its concern that the 

information could be used to fraudulently reverse engineer Stripe's proprietary processes and 

methodologies.

7. 

Both CX0421  and CX0422 contain business and trade secrets in the form of 

internal Stripe dashboards, which apply Stripe's secret formulas and technical information. 

Stripe uses this information in connection with its underwriting and risk assessments that are 

critical to its ability to offer payments processing services.  The competitive significance of the 

technical .formulas and confidential criteria in CX0421  and CX0422 is unlikely to decrease over 

time and thus, indefinite protection from public disclosure is appropriate. 

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  Executed
