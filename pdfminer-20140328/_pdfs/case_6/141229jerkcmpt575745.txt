MOTION OF RESPONDENT JERK, LLC, TO EXTEND TIME 

TO RESPOND TO THE COURT’S ORDER OF DECEMBER 22, 2014 

 
 

Respondent Jerk, LLC (hereinafter “Jerk”) hereby moves that this Honorable Court 

extend by one week the time for Jerk to respond to the Court’s Order of December 22, 2014 

(hereinafter the “Order”).  On December 22, the Court denied without prejudice Jerk’s motion 

seeking additional time to respond to overdue Requests for Admission.  In its Order, the Court 

specified that Jerk could, by today, submit a renewed motion including an explanation for prior 

delays and a detailed discovery plan.  Later on the same day that the Court issued its Order, the 

Commission issued an order that, among other things, rescheduled the evidentiary hearing in this 

matter from its original date in January to a new date of March 23, 2015.  In light of the 

December holidays and the revised hearing date, Jerk asks that the Court extend until January 5, 

2015, the deadline for Jerk to respond to the matters identified in the Court’s Order and seek 

reconsideration on the issue of its responses to Complaint Counsel’s Request for Admissions. 

 

WHEREFORE, Jerk respectfully requests that this Honorable Court extend the time for 

Jerk to respond to its Order of December 22, 2014 by one week, until January 5, 2015.
