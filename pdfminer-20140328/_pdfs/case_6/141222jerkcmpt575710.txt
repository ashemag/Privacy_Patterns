Docket No. 9361 

ORDER EXTENDING THE TIME FOR JERK, LLC TO RESPOND TO 

THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY DECISION AND RESCHEDULING THE 

EVIDENTIARY HEARING BEFORE THE ADMlNISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE 

On September 29,2014, Complaint Counsel moved for summary decision on the claims 
against Respondents Jerk, LLC ("Jerk") and John Fanning.  The Commission extended the time 
for Respondents to oppose the Motion for Summary Decision to November 4, and Mr.  Fanning 
opposed the motion but Jerk did not.  On November 12, Complaint Counsel filed a reply, and 
Mr. Fanning filed a surreply on November 19.  Subsequently, on December 8, Jerk reappeared 
and filed a "Motion to Extend the Time to Respond to Motion for Summary Decision, and to 
Reschedule the Evidentiary Hearing."  Complaint Counsel has opposed this motion. 

Jerk argues that it fully participated in this case until July 2014, when its prior attorney 

terminated her representation.  Jerk asserts that it had difficulty finding another attorney and was 
unrepresented until December 2, 2014, when it retained new counsel.  Jerk Mot. at 2.  Jerk 
contends that the Commission should vacate any fmdings or admissions entered against it by 
default and allow it to respond to the Motion for Summary Decision on the merits.  Specifically, 
Jerk seeks to:  (1) extend the deadline for its opposition to Complaint Counsel's Motion for 
Summary Decision to a date on or after January 26, 2015; (2) postpone the Commission's 
decision until after Jerk's response; and (3) reschedule the evidentiary hearing before the 
Administrative Law Judge to a date on or after March 2, 2015.  In the alternative, Jerk requests 
ten days to respond to Complaint Counsel's Motion for Summary Decision without changing the 
date ofthe evidentiary hearing.  Id.  ai.  i-2, n.2.  jerk argues that no party would be unduly 
prejudiced by a changed schedule because it no longer operates jerk. com or any other website; 
thus, there would be no detriment to consumers or the public.  Id.  at 3.
