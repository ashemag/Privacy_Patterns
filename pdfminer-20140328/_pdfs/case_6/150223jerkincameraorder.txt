ORDER ON MOTIONS FOR IN CAMERA  TREATMENT 

I. 

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

Pursuant to Rule 3.45(b) of the Rules of Practice of the Federal Trade Commission 

(""FTC''), the Scheduling Order entered in this matter on May 28, 2014, and the First Revised 
Scheduling Order entered in this matter on January 7, 2015, which reset the deadline for filing 
motions for in camera treatment to Febmary 17, 2015, FTC Complaint Counsel and two non(cid:173)
parties have filed motions for in camera treatment.  Neither Jerk, LLC, nor John Fanning 
("Respondents'') have filed any oppositions to these motions. 

As set forth below, the motion filed by Complaint Counsel is GRANTED; the motion 

filed  by Non-party Larry D.  Cox is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART; and the 
motion filed by Non-party Stripe, Inc.  is GRANTED. 

II. 

LEGALSTANDARDS 

Under Rule 3.45(b), the Administrative Law Judge may order that material offered into 
evidence .. be placed in camera only after finding that its public disclosure will likely result in a 
clearly defined, serious injury to the person, partnership or corporation requesting in camera 
treatment or after finding that the material constitutes sensitive personal information.''  16 C.P.R. 
§ 3.45(b). 

A. 

Clearly defined, serious injury 

.. [R]equests tor in camera treatment must show ·that the public disclosure of the 

documentary evidence will result in a clearly defined, serious injury to the person or corporation 

 

whose records are involved.'"  In re Kaiser Aluminum &  Chern.  Corp. , 103  F.T.C. 500, 500 
(1984), quoting in re H.  P. Hood & Sons,  Inc., 58 F.T.C. 1184, 1961  FTC LEXIS  368 (Mar.  14, 
1961 ).  Applicants must '·make a clear showing that the information concerned is sufficiently 
secret and sufficiently material to their business that disclosure would result in serious 
competitive injury."  In re General Foods C01p. , 95  F.T.C. 352, 1980 FTC LEXIS 99, at *10 
(Mar. 10, 1980).  If the applicants for in  camera treatment make this showing, the importance of 
the information in explaining the rationale of decisions at the Commission is "the principal 
cow1tervailing consideration weighing in favor of disclosure."  Id. 

The Federa] Trade Commission recognizes the "substantial public interest in holding all 

aspects of adjudicative proceedings, including the evidence adduced therein, open to all 
interested persons."  Hood, 1961  FTC LEXIS 368, at *5-6.  A full and open record ofthe 
adjudicative proceedings promotes public understanding of decisions at the Commission.  In re 
Bristol-Myers Co., 90 F.T.C. 455, 458 (1977).  A full and open record also provides guidance to 
persons affected by its actions and helps to deter potential violators of the laws the Commission 
enforces.  Hood, 58 F.T.C. at 1186.  The burden of showing good cause for withholding 
documents from the public record rests with the party requesting that documents be placed in 
camera.  Id. at 1188. 

In order to sustain the burden for withholding documents from the public record, an 
affidavit or declaration is required, demonstrating that a document is sufficiently secret and 
sufficiently material to the applicant's business that disclosme would result in serious 
competitive injury.  See in re North  Texas Specialty Physicians, 2004 FTC LEXIS 109, at *2-3 
(Apr. 23, 2004).  To overcome the presumption that in camera treatment will not be granted for 
information that is more than three years old, applicants seeking in camera treatment for such 
documents must also demonstrate, by affidavit or declaration, that such material remains 
competitively sensitive.  In addition, to properly evaluate requests for in camera treatment, 
applicants for in camera treatment must provide a copy of the documents for which they seek in 
camera treatment to the Administrative Law Judge for review. 

Under Commission Rule 3 .45(b )(3 ), indefinite in camera treatment is warranted only "in 

unusual circumstances," including circumstances in which "the need for confidentiality of the 
material ... is not likely to decrease over time ... :·  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b)(3).  The Commission 
has nonetheless recognized that "in some unusual cases 'the competitive sensitivity or the 
proprietary value of the information for which in camera treatment is requested will not 
necessarily diminish, and may actually increase, with the passage of time., .  In re Coca-Cola 
Co., 1990 FTC LEXIS 364, at *7 (Oct.  17, 1990) (quoting Commission comments on 
amendments to Rule 3.45).  In determining the length of time for which in  camera treatment is 
appropriate, the distinction between trade secrets and ordinary business records is important 
because ordinary business records are granted less protection than trade secrets.  See Hood, 58 
F.T.C. at  1189.  "Trade secrets'· are primarily limited to secret formulas, processes, and other 
secret technical information.  Id. ; General Foods, 95 F.T.C. at 352.  ·'Ordinary business records .. 
includes names of customers, prices to certain customers, and costs of doing business and profits. 
Hood, 58 F.T.C. at  1189. 

The Commission has recognized that it may be appropriate to provide in camera 

2 

treatment for certain business records.  In re Champion Spark Plug Co. ,  1982 FTC LEXIS 85, at 
*2 (April 5,  1982); see Hood, 58  F.T.C. at 1188-89; Kaiser Alum., 103 F.T.C. at 500.  Where in 
camera treatment is granted for business records, such as business strategies, marketing plans, 
pricing policies, or sales documents, it is typically provided for two to five years.  E.g. , In re 
Union Oil Co.  of Cal., 2004 FTC LEXIS 223, at *2 (Nov. 22, 2004); Conference Interpreters, 
1996 FTC LEXIS 298, at *13-14 (June 26,  1996); Champion Spark Plug, 1982 FTC LEXIS 85 
at *2  and 1982 FTC LEXIS 92, at *2 (March 4, 1982). 

B. 

Sensitive personal information 

Under Rule 3.45(b) of the Rules of Practice, after finding that material constitutes 

" sensitive personal information," the Administrative Law Judge shall order that such material be 
placed in camera.  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b).  "Sensitive personal information" is defined as including, 
but not limited to, '·an individuars Social Secmity number, taxpayer identification number, 
financial account number, credit card or debit card number, driver' s license number, state-issued 
identification number, passport number, date of birth (other than year), and any sensitive health 
information identifiable by individual, such as an individual's medical records."  16 C.F.R. 
§ 3.45(b). 

fn  addition to these listed categories of infonnation, in some circumstances, individuals' 
names and addresses, and witness telephone numbers have been found to be " sensitive personal 
information" and accorded in camera treatment.  in re LabMD, Inc., 2014 FTC LEXIS  127 (May 
6, 2014); In re Me Wane, Inc., 2012 FTC LEXIS 156 (September 17, 2012).  See also In re Basic 
Research, LLC, 2006 FTC LEXIS 14, at *5-6 (Jan. 25, 2006) (pem1itting the redaction of 
information concerning particular consumers'  names or other personal data where it was not 
relevant). 

·' [S]ensitive personal infonnation . . . shall be accorded permanent in camera h·eatment 
unless disclosure or an expiration date is required or provided by law!'  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b)(3). 

HI. 

COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S MOTION 

A. 

Sensitive Personal Information 

Complaint Counsel seeks permanent in camera treatment for the following categories of 
sensitive personal infom1ation of consumers who have complained about Jerk. com, the business 
allegedly owned and/or controlled by Respondents, or whose profiles on the Jerk.com website 
were captured by FTC staff as part of this investigation:  ( 1) names, (2) photographs, (3) 
telephone numbers, (4) addresses, (5)  e-mail addresses, and (6) online user names.  Although 
Respondents have not tiled any opposition to Complaint Counsel's motion, Complaint Counsel 
represents that Respondents do not oppose pennanent in camera treatment for "identification 
numbers, photographs, children ·s names/identification, emails, and usernames," but that 
Respondents do oppose petmanent in camera treatment for '·names and addresses of witnesses.'' 
Complaint Counsel maintains that the names and addresses of the consumers in this case 
constitute sensitive personal information. 

3 

 

The first set of trial exhibits for which Complaint Counsel seeks pem1anent in camera 

treatment consists of consumers' complaints about Jerk. com, including requests to have profiles 
removed from Jerk.com.  Complaint Counsel proposes to redact the sensitive personal 
information of consumers falling in the six categories listed above from this first set of 
documents.  Complaint Counsel asserts that consumer complainants would face abuse, 
harassment, and embarrassment if these individuals were identified through their personal 
information. 

The second set of trial exhibits for which Complaint Counsel seeks permanent in camera 
treatment consists of screen and video captures of consumer profiles displayed on Jerk.com and 
documented by FTC staffbetween May 2012 and March 2013.  Complaint Counsel asserts that 
the consumers recorded in these captures did not know that their profiles, and the sensitive 
personal infonnation contained therein, were being documented as part of a law enforcement 
investigation and that they did not give their consent to these captures. 1 

In this case, in light of the substantial privacy interest of protecting consumers from 

abuse, harassment, and embarrassment, consumer complainants'  personally identifiable 
information, including conswners' personally identifiable Jerk.com profiles, should be shielded 
from disclosure.  It does not appear that these individuals' personally identifying infonnation has 
any bearing on either the allegations of the Complaint or the defenses of the Respondents.  Thus, 
protection of this personally identifiable information would neither prejudice Respondents nor 
impede the public's ability to understand the arguments or evidence presented. 

B. 

Sensitive Personal Financial Information 

Complaint Counsel seeks pennanent in  camera treatment for the following categories of 
sensitive personal financial information:  (1) financial accoW1t numbers, (2) credit card or debit 
card numbers, (3) financial transaction numbers, (4) tax identification numbers, (5) dates of 
birth, and (6) personal signatures.  Complaint Counsel represents that Respondents do not oppose 
pennanent in  camera treatment for "financial information" and ·'identification numbers." 

Rule 3.45(b) identifies "sensitive personal information'' as including, but not limited to, 

Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, financial account numbers, credit card 
or debit card numbers, and dates of birth.  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b).  Financial transaction numbers 
and personal signatures, while not explicitly listed, are encompassed by the rule, as they also are 
individually identifiable pieces of information, the disclosure of which would expose the 
associated individuals to increased risk of harm. 

C. 

Limited Set of Sensitive Personal Information 

In addition to the requests for in  camera treatment for the documents described above, 

Complaint Counsel requests pennanent in camera treatment for the following categories of 
sensitive personal information contained in any other part ofthis action's evidentiary record: 

1 Complaint Counsel asserts that since the current online version of Jerk. com no  longer displays these profiles and 
Respondents have not provided Jerk.com profile screenshots or code for the site in response to discovery requests, 
these captures remain the most reliable means of presenting evidence of what was displayed on Jerk. com. 

4 

 

(I) personal phone numbers, (2) home addresses, (3) personal e-mail addresses, and (4) personal 
online usernames.  Complaint Counsel states that this sensitive information is contained in 
numerous places throughout the record, including deposition testimony and other documents. 
Complaint Counsel asks that in  camera treatment be granted to the requested categories of 
personal sensitive information for any matetial to be introduced into the evidentiary record in 
this matter. 

D. 

Summary 

Complaint Counsel has demonstrated that the information for which it seeks in camera 

treatment constitutes "sensitive personal information"  under the Commission's Rules ofPractice 
and therefore the information shall be accorded permanent in camera treatment, as set forth in 
Section VI below. 

IV.  MOTION FILED BY NON-PARTY LARRY D. COX 

Non-party LatTy D.  Cox ("Cox'') filed a motion for in camera treatment seeking 
permanent in camera treatment for three documents, which Cox desctibes as containing 
personally identifiable information.  Cox asserts that Respondent Jerk, LLC and Complaint 
Counsel do  not oppose Cox's motion. 

The three documents that are the subject of Cox's motion are:  CX0089, CX0090, and 

CX0091.  CX0089 is a one-page declaration executed by Cox, in which Cox describes his 
business or financial interactions with Respondent John Fanning and Jerk.com as an investor. 
CX0090 is a two-page certification of compliance and records, in which Cox certifies the 
authenticity of the documents he produced in response to the subpoena issued to Cox by 
Complaint Counsel.  CX0091  is described by Cox as "investor related paperwork with personal 
notes;· and is titled "Standard Non-Disclosw-e Agreement." 

These three exhibits are "ordinary" business documents.  Cox has not demonstrated that 

the public disclosure of these exhibits '·will result in a clearly defined, setious injury to the 
person or corporation whose records are involved.''  Hood, 58  F.T.C.  1184.  With the exception 
of one line in CX0089, in which Cox explains the reason for receiving mail from Respondents at 
Cox' s business address, these documents do  not contain "sensitive personal information; · as 
defined by the Commission's Rules ofPractice. 

V. 

MOTION FILED BY NON-PARTY STRIPE, INC. 

Non-party Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe") tiled a motion for in camera treatment seeking 

pennanent in camera treatment for two competitively-sensitive, confidential business 
documents?  Stripe asserts that Respondent Jerk, LLC and Complaint Counsel both indicated to 
Stripe that they do not oppose Stripe's motion and that Respondent Fanning did not respond to 
Stripe's inquiry. 

2  Stripe states that Complaint Counse l' s Motion for ln Camera Treatment includes a request for in camera treatment 
for the sensitive personal information contained  in five documents  produced by Stripe. CX0421-CX0425. and that 
Stripe joins in that request. 

5 

 

The two documents that are the subject of Stripe's motion are:  CX0421  and CX0422. 
Stripe has supported its motion with the declaration of Mr. Jon Zieger, Stripe's general counsel 
and corporate secretary ("Zieger Declaration'').  According to  the Zieger Declaration:  (] ) 
CX0421  is a snapshot of Stripe's internal underwriting ''dashboard,'' which reflects the 
underwriting and risk analysis of merchants who  apply to do business with Stripe, and which 
contains confidential information about Stripe's personnel and how they evaluate customer 
applications; and (2)  CX0422 is a printout of Stripe's account dashboard, which contains 
information about consumer transactions for a particular merchant account, the disclosure of 
which would reveal what systems Stripe uses to process the accounts and charges, as well as how 
underwriters at Stripe review risk and make assessments.  According to the Zieger Declaration, 
Stripe keeps this information in strict confidence, Stripe has devoted significant resources in 
developing its proprietary processes and technical systems or formulas, and public di~closure of 
this infom1ation would result in serious competitive harm to Stripe.  In addition, according to the 
Zieger Declaration, both CX0421  and CX0422 contain business and trade secrets in the form of 
internal Stripe dashboards, which apply Stripe's secret formulas and technical information, and 
the competitive significance of the technical formula and confidential criteria in CX0421  and 
CX0422 is unlikely to decrease over time. 

Non-party Stripe has met its burden of demonstrating that CX0421  and CX0422 are 

entitled to indefinite in camera treatment. 

VI.  ORDER

CX0089, and as to CX0090 and CX0091, Cox's motion is DENIED. 

As set forth above, Non-party Stripe's Motion is GRANTED.  Indefinite in camera
