ORIGI'NAL 

COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S OPPOSITION TO 

RESPONDENT JERK, LLC'S MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO ANSWER 

COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S SECOND REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS 

Respondent Jerk, LLC ("Jerk") asks this Court to permit it to withdraw its admissions 

and provide amended responses to Complaint Counsel's Second Request for Admissions 

("RF As")-a full month after Jerk's admissions become deemed under the Commission's Rules 

of Practice.  Jerk provides no justification for its extreme delay, or its continual failures to meet 

discovery obligations and comply with the Court' s orders.  Jerk's proposed relief would both 

undermine the resolution of this action on its merits and significantly prejudice Complaint 

Counsel.  The Court should deny Jerk's request. 

I. 

BACKGROU.ND 

On November 4, 2014 Complaint Counsel served the RFAs on Jerk by emailing Ms. 

Maria Crimi Speth, the counsel who had previously entered an appearance for Jerk in this action, 

and by mailing a copy to Jerk's registered agent-both methods authorized by the Chief 

Administrative Law Judge's Order ofNovember 3, 2014.  (Burke Dec.~ 14)  Complaint Counsel 

1 

PUBLIC 

also provided copies of the RFAs to the Secretary.  (ld.) 

Complaint Counsel did not receive any response to the RF As from Jerk by the end of the 

ten-day period prescribed by Rule 3.32(b), nor was a copy provided to the Secretary.  (Id.  at~ 

15)  Jerk's non-response was not surprising for at least two reasons.  First, Jerk has failed to 

participate in this litigation for the past five months.  Since mid-July, Jerk has riot produced any 

documents, subpoenaed any party, attended any deposition, or responded to any motion.  (!d.  at~ 

13)  Jerk twice failed to produce any representative for a noticed company deposition, even after 

the Court ordered Jerk to produce a deponent on August 15.  (!d.  at~~ 9-10)  Similarly, Jerk has 

not responded to Complaint Counsel's two sets of interrogatories and second set of document 

requests, in violation of this Court's orders of August 15 and November 25.  (!d.  at ~~ 8, 11) 1 

Second, Jerk did not controvert any of the material facts and supporting evidence submitted to 

the Commission by Complaint Counsel in support of their Motion for Summary Decision.  (I d.  at 

~ 13)  Since these uncontroverted material facts independently established many of the matters 

the RFAs sought Jerk to admit, Jerk's constructive admission through silence was not 

unexpected. 

On November 25, 2014, Complaint Counsel filed its Motion to Supplement the Record on 

Complaint Counsel 's Pending Motion for Summary Decision to supplement the record with 

Jerk's and Fanning's deemed admissions.  After taking no action in this case for months, Jerk 

immediately hired new counsel on December 2.  (Burke Dec.~ 16)  On December 5, 2014, the 

1 After announcing her intention to withdraw from representation in this action, Jerk' s first 
counsel, Maria Crimi Speth, has ignored Complaint Counsel's repeated requests to seek leave to 
withdraw and to provide a point of contact at Jerk with whom Complaint Counsel could discuss 
this action in the absence of outside representation.  (Burke Dec. ~~ 4, 6, Atts. B, C)  Even at her 
deposition, Ms. Speth would not identify any Jerk member, officer, director, or employee, or any 
other counsel who represented Jerk.  (!d.  Att. I at 46:7-49:7) 

2 

Commission denied the Motion to Supplement without prejudice, and granted Respondents a 

week to seek reliefunder Rule 3.32(c) for their failure to timely respond to the RFAs.  After that 

order, Jerk' s new counsel filed a notice of appearance, contacted Complaint Counsel for the first 

PUBLIC 

time, and filed the pending motion.  (ld. at ~ 16) 

ll. 

LEGALSTANDARD 

By operation of the Commission' s rules, a party that does not respond to requests for 

admission by the prescribed deadline is deemed to have admitted all the matters presented 

therein.  See 16 C.P.R.§ 3.32(b); see also Luickv. Graybar Electric Co., 473 F.2d 1360, 1362 

(8th Cir. 1973) (holding that, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, "[u]nanswered requests 

for admissions render the matter requested conclusively established for the purpose of that suit"); 

United States v.  2204 Barbara Lane, 960 F.2d 126, 129 (11th Cir.  1992) (defendants' failure to 

respond to requests for admissions constituted conclusive admission on decisive matters); cf 

Rainbolt v.  Johnson, 669 F.2d 767, 768 (D.C. Cir.  1981) (reversing the district court for failing 

to give binding and conclusive effect to unanswered requests for admissions). 

The deemed admission is "conclusively established, unless the Administrative Law Judge 

on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission."  16 C.F. R. § 3.32(c).  The 

Administrative Law Judge may permit withdrawal or amendment of admissions when (1) the 

presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby, and (2) the party who obtained 

the admission fails to satisfy the ALJ that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice that party in 

maintaining the action or defense on the merits.  ld.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(b) 

articulates an almost identical standard.  See Hadley v.  United States, 45 F.3d 1345, 1347 (9th 

Cir. 1995).  Because the standard is discretionary, even where both factors are present, a court 

may still exercise its discretion to refuse withdrawal and substitution of admissions.  See 

3 

PUBLIC 

Kingstro v.  Cnty.  of San Bernardino, No. CV 12-4673-S, 2014 WL 3571803, at *8-9 (C.D. Cal. 

July 18, 2014).  Additionally, courts may consider other circumstances, such as whether the party 

seeking withdrawal has good cause for doing so or has a strong case on the merits.  Conlon v. 

United States,  474 F.3d 616, 624-25 (9th Cir. 2007). 

III.  ARGUMENT 

A.  Allowing Jerk to withdraw its admissions at this late stage will not 

promote the resolution of this case on the merits. 

Permitting Jerk to withdraw its admissions and instead provide substitute responses will 

not promote the resolution of this case on the merits versus maintaining the deemed admissions. 

Complaint Counsel have already established, through overwhelming evidence developed 

independent of Jerk's admissions, the matters that Jerk has constructively admitted on RF As 1 

through 5.  (See generally Complaint Counsel's Statement of Material Facts, Sept. 29, 2014). 

This evidentiary record, presented with Complaint Counsel's Motion for Summary Decision, 

was submitted to the Commission more than a month before Jerk's deemed admissions.  Thus, 

this is not a situation where Complaint Counsel want to rely on Jerk's deemed admissions to 

bypass the presentation of the case on the merits and eliminate the matter by virtue of the 

admissions alone.  Cf Kingstro, 2014 WL 3571803, at *9 (citing Hadley,  45 F.3d at 1348).  On 

the contrary, Jerk's deemed admissions wholly parallel and reaffirm Complaint Counsel's 

independently developed evidence, which remains uncontroverted by either Respondent.  (See 

Complaint Counsel's Mtn. to Supplement the Record on Summary Decision, Nov. 25, 2014, at 

pp. 6-7). 

Now, having evaded its obligations to participate in discovery and to rebut the pending 

motion for summary decision with facts and evidence of its own, Jerk openly admits that it plans 

to use its substitute RF A responses to challenge summary decision, by manufacturing the 

4 

PUBLIC 

appearance of a factual dispute where none exists.  See Jerk's Mtn. to Extend Time, Dec. 8, 

2014, at p. 2) ("Jerk seeks the opportunity to attempt to vacate any findings or admissions 

entered against it by default, and to respond to the Motion· for Summary Decision on the 

merits.") 

If it survives summary deci sion, Jerk, in the purported interest of resolving this case on 

the " merits," will undoubtedly proceed to rely on its substituted RFA denials to marshal 

previously undiscovered evidence and witnesses for trial, despite the fact that discovery has been 

closed for weeks and Complaint Counsel have already submitted their exhibit and witness lists. 

This proceeding will become subsumed by countless requests to excuse Jerk's delinquencies on 

other matters, undermining the Commission' s objective for speedy litigation.  See  16 C.F.R. § 

3.11 (b)( 4); see also 74 FR 1808 (Jan. 13, 2009) ("the five and eight month deadlines" set by Rule 

3.ll(b)(4) are "more than satisfY due process requirements because respondent will have ample 

time for broad discovery and a respondent may also move for more time upon a showing of good 

cause under Rule 3.2l(c)" (emphasis added)).  Jerk has already received several extensions to 

comply with its discovery obligations and to oppose summary decision.  (See, e.g., Court Order 

of Aug. 15, 2014; Court Order ofNov. 25, 2014; Comm'n Order of Oct. 9, 2014).  It has ignored 

all those orders.  Permitting Jerk yet another do-over on the eve of trial would move from 

leniency to indulgence.  Rockwell Automation, Inc.  v.  United States, 7 F. Supp. 3d 1278, 1304 

(United States Court oflntemational Trade) (after obtaining relief, movant "should expect no 

leniency whatsoever in the future").2 

Furthermore, Jerk has made no specific showing, other than the bare assertion that cases 

should generally be decided on the merits, that allowing Jerk to withdraw its admissions will 
promote the resolution of this case on the merits.  The fact that Jerk does not even state which of 
its eight admissions are factually wrong, let alone explain how the facts of the case contradict 
them, further exposes its present request as a maneuver to secure a tactical advantage for itself, 

5 

PUBLIC 

B.  Allowing Jerk to withdraw its admissions at this late stage will prejudice 

Complaint Counsel. 

Permitting withdrawal and substitution of Jerk' s admissions at this late stage poses 

significant prejudice to Complaint Counsel because Jerk has deprived Complaint Counsel of the 

opportunity to obtain discovery needed to counter Jerk's intended denials.  Despite the title of its 

pending motion, Jerk is not merely seeking an opportunity to make up for one missed deadline. 

It seeks an opportunity to redo the entire pretrial phase of this litigation.  Jerk has effectively 

disappeared from the case for the majority of the discovery period, ignoring multiple deadlines, 

motions, and Court orders,  including the Court's warning that "Jerk remains a party in this case 

and is not entitled to ignore a discovery motion."  (Order of Aug.  15, 2014).3 

In adopting this strategy, Jerk has insulated itself from depositions and numerous 

interrogatories and document requests.  Jerk's present admissions stand as the bulwark against its 

noncompliance strategy.  With the admissions, the pernicious impact of Jerk' s noncompliance 

strategy has been mitigated; the admissions prevent Jerk from resting on previously undiscovered 

not an endeavor toward a resolution on the merits. 

Jerk has not provided a justification for its dilatory behavior.  Jerk merely asserts that it 

found itself unrepresented by counsel when it received the RF As, and that it "recognizes the 
difficulties presented by the withdrawal of its counsel ... . "  (Jerk Mtn. at 1)  Construing Jerk as 
arguing that it faced difficulty in finding another attorney after the withdrawal of a previous one, 
Jerk fails to explain what that difficulty was or why it prevented Jerk from participating in this 
action for five months.  See Kagan v.  Caterpillar Tractor Co.,  795 F.2d 60 1, 611 (7th Cir.  1986) 
(while difficulty in obtaining counsel "might explain a brief delay,"  it does "not justify the total 
silence . .. for more than 45 days").  Indeed, Jerk's systematic failure to participate in discovery 
and obey Court orders illustrates not only a lack of good cause for seeking to withdraw its 
admissions, see Conlon, 474 F.3d at 625, but also an absence of good faith.  See Rockwell, 7 F. 
Supp. 3d at 1302 (rejecting good faith where the tardy party's "track record smacks of a blatant 
disregard for the rules"); Nafziger v.  McDermott lnt'l, Inc., 467 F.3d 514, 523 (6th Cir. 2006) 
(citing "numerous instances of 'previous dilatory conduct'"); cf Perry v.  Wolaver, 2006 WL 
1071888, at *2 (D. Me. Apr. 24, 2006) (finding good faith where the action "has otherwise been 
dutifully litigated").  Indeed, Jerk's misconduct is so severe, it likely constitutes a basis for 
sanctions under Rule 3.38(b). 

6 

PUBLIC 

and untested evidence to ambush Complaint Counsel and the Court.  Without the admissions, 

now that fact discovery has closed, Jerk will be free to sidestep its discovery obligations and to 

proceed to the evidentiary hearing six weeks away unencumbered by the rigors of discovery.4 

Such an outcome would contravene both the Commission's rules and well-established principles 

of American litigation and would force Complaint Counsel into a trial by ambush. 5 

IV. 

CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Jerk's motion. 

Instead of addressing, or even acknowledging, the obvious prejudice to Complaint 

4 
Counsel, Jerk merely concludes that there will be no prejudice and moves on.  (Jerk Mtn. p. 2) 
On the other hand, Jerk argues that the prejudice to itself for having to suffer the naturally(cid:173)
flowing consequences of its noncompliance strategy would constitute "manifest" prejudice by 
preventing Jerk from  defending the case on the merits.  First, the prejudice to Jerk is irrelevant 
under Rule 3.32(c).  Second, as explained in Part A, supra, the orderly resolution of this case on 
the merits would be disserved by Jerk's gamesmanship.  Third, the cases on which Jerk relies are 
entirely inapposite in light of Jerk' s conduct in this action.  In each of these cases, a party 
received relief from default because it was genuinely unaware of some critical component of the 
case against it and promptly attempted to cure the default when made aware of it.  See Coon v. 
Grenier, 867 F.2d 73 (1st Cir.  1989) (setting aside default 9*8because the defendant had never 
been served and thus had no opportunity to contest); United States v.  One Parcel of Real 
Property, 763 F.2d 181  (5th Cir. 1985) (setting aside default where the owner had no awareness 
ofthe forfeiture action); Feliciano v.  Reliant Tool Col., Ltd.,  691  F.2D 653 (3d Cir.  1982) 
(setting aside default because the party had attempted to comply with discovery obligations 
diligently and without bad faith).  That is not the case here, where Jerk affirmatively dropped out 
of this litigation with full knowledge ofthe consequences for doing so and then willfully ignored 
its discovery obligations and Court orders. 

See "How Courts Work," American Bar Association,

http://www .americanbar .org/ groups/pub I ic _education/resources/law _related_ education_ 
network/how_courts_work/discovery (discovery is "designed to prevent 'trial by ambush,' where 
one side doesn't learn of the other side's evidence or witnesses until trial, when there's no time 
to obtain answering evidence.").

DECLARATION OF BEATRICE BURKE IN SUPPORT OF COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S 

OPPOSITION TO RESPONDENT JERK, LLC'S MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO 

ANSWER COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S SECOND REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS 

In accordance with 28  U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the 

following is true and correct: 

1.  I am over 18 years of age, and I am a citizen of the United States.  I am employed by the 

Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as a paralegal in the FTC's Western Regional Office 

in San Francisco.  I have worked and continue to work as a paralegal for Complaint 

Counsel in the above-captioned matter, and I have personal knowledge of the facts  set 

forth herein.  I am currently a member of the California Army National Guard Reserve 

and a United States Army veteran from active duty. 

2.  When Complaint Counsel filed the Complaint in this action on April 7, 2014, Respondent 

Jerk, LLC ("Jerk") was represented by Counsel Maria Speth of the law firm Jaburg & 

Wilk, P.C.  These counsel filed a notice of appearance on Jerk's behalf on April24, 2014 

and filed Jerk's Answer to the Complaint on May 19, 2014. 

3.  Attached hereto as Attachment A is a true and correct copy of an email string between 

Complaint Counsel and Ms. Speth in June 2014 discussing Jerk' s designation ofMr. 

PUBLIC DOCUMENT 

Fanning as Jerk's company representative and his appearance in that capacity for 

deposition in Boston on July 28, 2014. 

4.  Attached hereto as Attachment B and Attachment C are true and correct copies of email 

exchanges between Complaint Counsel and Ms. Speth between July 18 and July 30, 

2014. 

5.  Attached hereto as Attachment D is a Notice Regarding Representation filed by Ms. 

Speth in this action on July 30, 2014.  Despite filing this notice, neither Ms. Speth nor 

Jaburg &  Wilk have moved to withdraw from this action as Jerk's counsel. 

6.  Neither Ms. Speth nor Jaburg &  Wilk identified for Complaint Counsel any other counsel 

representing Jerk.  Nor has Jerk identified to Complaint Counsel any other counsel 

representing it until December 8, 2014, when Jerk's counsel David Duncan called 

Complaint Counsel Sarah Schroeder to discuss Jerk's opposition to summary decision. 

7.  Since July 18, Jerk has not responded to Complaint Counsel's discovery requests; has not 

produced any documents to Complaint Counsel; has not provided to Complaint Counsel 

any copies of subpoenas sent by Jerk to any party; has not attended any deposition 

noticed or attended by Complaint Counsel; and has not served Complaint Counsel with a 

response to motions filed in this action. 

8.  On June 24, 2014, Complaint Counsel served their First Set oflnterrogatories on Jerk. 

To date, Jerk has not responded to these Interrogatories, notwithstanding the Chief 

Administrative Law Judge's August 15, 2014 order requiring Jerk to provide responses 

by August 20, 2014. 

9.  To date, no designated representative for Jerk has appeared to be deposed by Complaint 

Counsel in this action.  On July 2, 2014, Complaint Counsel served on Jerk a notice for 

deposition, pursuant to Commission Rule 3.33(c)(l), of Jerk's representative(s) to be held 

on July 28, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts.  Attached hereto as Attachment E  is a true 

and correct copy of this notice.  No representative for Jerk appeared at this deposition. 

2 

PUBLIC DOCUMENT 

Attached hereto as Attachment F is a true and correct copy of the transcript of this 

deposition. 

10. After the Chief Administrative Law Judge's August 15,2014 order requiring Jerk to 

produce an individual to testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the 

organization in response to Complaint Counsel's 3.33(c)(l) deposition notice, Complaint 

Counsel served Jerk with a second deposition notice on August 18, 2014, noticing Jerk's 

deposition for August 27, 2014 in  San Francisco, CA.  Attached hereto as Attachment G 

is a true and correct copy of this notice.  No representative for Jerk appeared at this 
deposition.  Attached hereto as Attachment His a true and correct copy of the transcript 
ofthis deposition. 

11. On October 7, 2014, Complaint Counsel served their Second Set ofinterrogatories and 

Second Requests for Production of Documents on Jerk.  To date, Jerk has not responded 

to these Interrogatories and Requests for Production, in spite of the Chief Administrative 

Law Judge' s November 25, 2014 Order granting Complaint Counsel's motion to require 

Jerk to provide responses within seven days of the Order. 

12. Attached hereto as Attachment I  is a true and correct copy of transcript excerpts from 

the October 7, 2014 deposition of Ms. Speth in this action. 

13. On information and belief, since mid-July, Jerk has not produced any documents, 

subpoenaed any party, attended any deposition, or responded to any motion in this matter. 

Jerk submitted no opposition to Complaint Counsel' s Motion for Summary Decision, and 

did not controvert apy of the material facts or supporting evidence submitted to the 

Commission by Complaint Counsel in support of their Motion for Summary Decision. 

14. Attached hereto as Attachment J is a true and correct copy of Complaint Counsel's 

Second Request for Admissions to Respondent Jerk, LLC ("200 Set ofRFAs"), which I 

served on Jerk on November 4, 2014, at approximately 1:46 pm Pacific by email to 

counsel Ms. Maria Crimi Speth, at the email address Ms. Speth had previously provided 

3 

PUBLIC DOCUMENT 

for use in this litigation and has used to correspond with Complaint Counsel.  That day, I 

also served an additional copy on Jerk by overnight delivery to Jerk's registered agent, 

National Registered Agents, Inc. in Dover, Delaware.  I also emailed a copy of the 2nd Set 

of RF As to the Office of the Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission. 

15. Complaint Counsel never received a response to the 2nd Set ofRFAs, whether within ten 

days or otherwise.  A representative of the Office of the Secretary has confirmed to 

Complaint Counsel that it also has not received any response to the 2"d Set ofRF As. 

16. On December 8, 2014, Jerk's new counsel, David A. Russcol and David Duncan of 

Zalkind Duncan &  Bernstein LLP, first contacted Complaint Counsel.  On information 

and belief, Jerk retained this new counsel on December 2, 2014. 

I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 

Executed on December 16, 2014, in San Francisco, CA.

RE: Docket 9361-Jerk, LLC. et al.- Jerk, LLC  deposition 

I asked for the categories so 1 could figure out who to designate, or frankly, if I had anyone to designate.  As you know 
Jerk, LLC is not an operating entity.  Once you  provided the categories, I was  able to determine t hat John Fanning is  a 
person with some knowledge.  I re-read Rule 3.3.3 to make sure I wasn't missing something.  It says: 

»The organization so named shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents,  or other persons who 
consent to testify on its behalf,  and may set forth , for each person designated, the matters on which he  or she will testify: 

I think the use of the word "may" makes it very clear that it is at the option of the organization. 

Also, there is nothing to scramble about.  The company has no way of compelling anyone to appear for a deposition, so if 
John doesn't know an answer,  I very likely can't produce someone who does.

Hi Maria, 

Whether you want to move to quash or limit is of course up to you.  If you want to object to some of our 
categories as beyond the scope of permissible discovery, you should do that in advance of the deposition, as 
contemplated by Rule 3.33(b).  In any event, you  must, under Rule 3.33(c), set forth the topics on which the 
corporate representative will testify.  This is squarely a matter of complying with the Rules, and doing so in 
good faith. 

You asked us, emphatically, to provide you with a list of deposition categories in advance of even telling us 
who Jerk's corporate representative will be.  We did that very quickly, working diligently to set out a clearly 
articulated list of categories reasonably expected to yield information relevant to the allegations of the 
complaint, to the proposed relief, and to your defenses.  Now that you've designated Mr. Fanning, you need to 
identify the categories for which you've designated him.  We can't go into the 3.33(c) deposition blind, without 
knowing what Mr.  Fanning will and won't be able to testify about on behalf of Jerk.  That would just set us up 
for having to scramble for additional depositions and motions to compel, wasting everyone's time, including the 
court's.  If we have a legitimate dispute about the scope of our deposition categories or the need for additional 
corporate designees if Mr.  Fanning can't testify fully, we should work to resolve it now as opposed to waiting 
another month and a half.  But we can't begin until you let us know what topics Mr.  Fanning will be able to 
cover.

Sarah: 

I don' t think the rules require me to do any of those things.  I do not think a motion to quash is warranted.  I was simply 
trying to avoid the FTC saying that Jerk, LLC has somehow agreed to the relevance of everything in your list just because 
we designated a witness.  I also do not think that I need to identify which categories Mr. Fanning has knowledge about 
and which he doesn't.  i think that is the purpose ofthe deposition.

Maria: 

Thank you for confirming.  In  rereading your disclaimers at the end of your email, I want to make sure we're on 
the same page about the deposition.  While I didn't set out to interpret your designation of Mr. Fanning as a 
waiver of objections, it's hard for me to evaluate your objections before I understand what they are.  We 
discussed some of your reservations about some of the deposition categories very quickly during our call  last 
week, but I don't think we made it through all the topics, and to be honest, my notes about your objections 
aren 't crystal clear. 

Here's what I propose:  To the extent you have legitimate objections to any of the deposition topics, I encourage 
you to prepare a motion to quash or limit under Rule 3.34.  We are of course happy to discuss those topics 
beforehand with the aim of obviating the need for the motion or reducing its scope.  Speaking candidly, we took 
great pains to make sure that the deposition categories were clearly stated and well within the scope of 
pennissible discovery under the Rules, so there's a good chance that any disagreement between us may be about 
semantics, in which case we will  likely be able to work through it without need for the court's intervention. 

If your reservations are not about the propriety of our questions but instead about Mr.  Fanning's inability to 
testify about certain categories for lack of knowledge, can you please Jet us know for which categories you will 
designate Mr. Fanning as a testifying as Jerk's rep, and then we can discuss the potential need to  line up other 
Jerk officers to cover the remaining categories.  Since I'm out of the office next week and want to make 
progress on this, it would be very helpful if you could get that designation list to us before Thursday so we can 
have a meet and confer on Thursday or Friday.

Subject: RE:  Docket 9361-Jerk, LLC.  et al.- Jerk, LLC deposition 

Sarah: 

This is to confirm our conversation today regarding your notice of deposition of Jerk, LLC.  Jerk, LLC designates John 
Fanning as a person who has knowledge on some of the matters specified in your attached notice.  Rule 3.33(c} {1} 
requires you to describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested.  While some of 
the categories are reasonably particular, others are not.  Based upon the information it has, Jerk, LLC believes that John 
Fanning is the proper person to designate. 

As we also discussed, we have agreed to July 28 as the date of that deposition, which is the day before Mr. Fanning's 
deposition in his personal capacity. 

Also, I want to be clear that the designation of John Fanning under Rule 3.33(c )(1) is not a waiver of our objection 
that  some of the categories in the attached notice are not  reasonably expected to yield information relevant to the 
allegations of the complaint, to the proposed relief, or to the defenses of any respondent.  It is also not an admission 
that John Fanning is designated for any purpose other than that he has knowledge of some ofthe categories.

Maria, 

I hope you had a good vacation. 

I understand your frustration, but Complaint Counsel is obligated to share certain material with attorneys who have 
entered an appearance in this matter. I again urge you to file a motion to withdraw or contact Chief Judge Chappell's 
clerk.  In the meantime, we will continue to satisfy our obligations under the rules.  If you would prefer, we can send 
material just to your legal assistant. 

Also, we intend to file a motion for discovery sanctions pursuant to Rule 3.38.  Please let me know when you are 
available to meet and confer about this motion. 

Best Regards 
Sarah

I am back and trying to catch  up.  Your email below says the FTC administrative rules are unclear.  I actually think they 
are silent on the issue.  Absent a rule stating otherwise, I have no reason to believe that I have to file a motion to 
withdraw and I don't  plan to do so.  I don't  represent this client any longer,  I have no authority to act on its behalf, and 
there is no rule or any reference that would lead me to believe that I have to seek permission from the AU.

Subject: Motion to withdraw as counsel 

Thanks Maria.  I know it's a hassle, but you need to file a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel.  When the FTC 
administrative rules are unclear, Chief Judge Chappell has referred to the federal rules or the rules of other 
courts for guidance.  As you know, most coutts require attorneys who have entered an appearance to obtain the 
judge's permission to withdraw as counsel.  These rules are designed to prevent prejudice to the other 
party.  We would not oppose your motion to withdraw provided that you give us contact infonnation for Jerk, 
LLC or the individual that you have been dealing with on behalf of Jerk, LLC, or successor counsel if you' ve 
now been informed of one.  We need this information to get a sense of how Jerk plans to proceed in the 
litigation after your withdrawal, and more immediately, to confinn the corporate deposition set for next 
Monday.

Maria, 

I understand that you're no longer representing Jerk, but per my email last week, until the ALJ actually grants 
your withdrawal, we still have an obligation to communicate with Jerk through you.  If you're no longer 
authorized to represent Jerk, what I can propose is to  have us communicate directly with the company -(cid:173)
presumably, with Mr.  Fanning in his representative capacity-- until Jerk retains new counsel, as long as I have 
your and the company's authorization to do so.  Please let me know if that works for you.
