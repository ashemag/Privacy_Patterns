DOCKET NO. 9361 

ORDER MODIFYING AUGUST 23, 2016 ORDER 

On May 9, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued an 

 
opinion affirming “the Commission’s entry of summary decision as to liability [in this 
proceeding] and all provisions of its remedial order except for compliance monitoring as to 
[Respondent John] Fanning.”  Fanning v. Federal Trade Commission, 821 F.3d 164, 177-78 (1st 
Cir. 2016).  The court vacated and remanded that portion of the Commission’s Final Order for 
further proceedings consistent with the court’s opinion.  Id. at 178.  The court entered its 
judgment on May 9, 2016; no petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc was filed; and no 
petition for writ of certiorari was filed within the ninety days prescribed by the Rules of the 
United States Supreme Court.  Therefore, on August 23, the Commission issued an Order 
Scheduling Briefing On Remand requesting briefing on how to address the Court of Appeals’ 
ruling. 
 
 
that he had in fact attempted to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, but 
that it had been returned to him for failure to comply with the Rules of the Supreme Court. 
Mr. Fanning submitted a copy of a letter dated August 15, 2016 from the Clerk of Court 
confirming what had happened and stating that Mr. Fanning has 60 days from the date of the 
letter to file a corrected petition. 
 

On September 6, Mr. Fanning filed a Response and Opposition to our Order informing us 

 

In light of the additional time that has been given to Mr. Fanning to file a corrected 

petition for writ of certiorari, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is not yet final.  We have 
therefore determined to vacate the briefing schedule set forth in our August 23 Order until all 
appellate judicial proceedings in this case have been completed.  At that point, the Commission 
will issue an order resuming proceedings as appropriate.   
 

Accordingly,  
 
IT IS ORDERED THAT the August 23, 2016 Order is hereby modified by vacating the 

briefing schedule set forth in the ordering paragraph. 

 
By the Commission.
