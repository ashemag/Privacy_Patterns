UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

BEFORE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

ORDER ON REMAND REVISING COMPLIANCE MONITORING REQUIREMENT 

On March 13, 2015, the Commission issued an Opinion deciding that Respondents Jerk, 
 
LLC (“Jerk”) and John Fanning had engaged in deceptive conduct in violation of Section 5(a) of 
the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a).  Jerk, LLC, 159 F.T.C. 885 (2015).  An accompanying Final 
Order imposed cease-and-desist and other relief.  Id. at 939-44.  The United States Court of 
Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the Commission’s finding of liability and sustained all 
aspects of the Commission’s remedial order other than a compliance monitoring provision, 
which it remanded to the Commission for further consideration.  Fanning v. FTC, 821 F.3d 164 
(1st Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 627 (Jan. 9, 2017).  This Order addresses the remanded 
issue and modifies the compliance monitoring requirement to reflect the court’s rulings.   

I. 

BACKGROUND 

This proceeding arose from an administrative complaint, which alleged that Respondents 

 
had engaged in deceptive acts or practices through the operations of their website, Jerk.com.  
Jerk.com was a social media website that invited users to create profiles of other individuals and 
to rate them as a “jerk” or “not a jerk.”  The Commission found that Respondents had falsely 
represented that content on Jerk.com, including the names and photographs in profiles, had been 
created by the website’s users and reflected users’ views of the profiled individuals, when in fact 
that content was almost entirely “scraped” from Facebook by Jerk itself or those under Jerk’s 
control.  159 F.T.C. at 902-06.  The Commission further determined that Jerk.com had falsely 

 

1 

claimed that consumers who paid a $30 membership fee would receive additional benefits, 
including the ability to dispute information posted on the site, but in fact had provided nothing in 
return for the membership fees.  Id. at 912-16.  The Commission found that Mr. Fanning had the 
authority to control, and controlled and participated directly in, Jerk’s unlawful conduct and 
concluded that he was individually liable for Jerk’s deceptive acts.  Id. at 917-27. 

Mr. Fanning sought judicial review.1  The court of appeals sustained the Commission’s 
 
findings that the Jerk.com website contained material and false representations about the source 
of its content and the benefits of the $30 paid membership.  Fanning, 821 F.3d at 170-74.  It 
observed that Mr. Fanning had developed no argument as to why the Commission’s finding of 
personal liability was wrong and ruled that this contention had been waived.  Id. at 169 n.4.  As 
to remedy, the court affirmed the core of the Commission’s Final Order, which enjoined Mr. 
Fanning from making any misrepresentation about the source of any content on a website or 
regarding the benefits of joining any service.  Id. at 174-75.  The court also affirmed, inter alia, 
provisions requiring that for five years Mr. Fanning notify the Commission of any complaints or 
inquiries relating to any website or other online service and that he maintain and make available 
advertisements and promotional materials containing any representations covered by the order.  
Id. at 175-76.   

The court of appeals, however, remanded one portion of the Commission’s Final Order,  

 
Paragraph VI, which reads:  

VI. 

COMPLIANCE MONITORING – JOHN FANNING 

     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent John Fanning, for a period of 
ten (10) years after the date of issuance of this order, shall notify the Commission 
of the discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of his affiliation 
with any new business or employment.  The notice shall include respondent’s new 
business address and telephone number and a description of the nature of the 
business or employment and his duties and responsibilities. 

The court was unable to find a reasonable relation between this provision and Mr. Fanning’s 
violation.  821 F.3d at 176.  It noted that the provision requires that Mr. Fanning notify the 
Commission of business affiliations and employment “regardless of whether or not the affiliate 
or employer has responsibilities relating to the order.”  Id. at 177 (stating that the provision 
“would ostensibly require Fanning to report if he was a waiter at a restaurant”).  It observed that 
while courts in a number of previous FTC Act cases had imposed orders requiring individuals to 
report any change of business for twenty years, none of the cited orders required individuals to 
also provide descriptions of their employers and business for more than five years.  Id. at 177 & 
                                                 
1 Jerk did not file a petition for review. 

 

2 

n.9.  It found that the prior compliance monitoring orders had been “almost entirely bereft of 
analysis that might explain the rationale for such a requirement.”   Id. at 177.  “Without any 
guidance from the Commission,” the court concluded, “we cannot find these provisions are 
reasonably related to Fanning’s violation.  As a result, we conclude the Commission’s order, in 
this respect, must be vacated and remanded.”  Id. 

II. 

Analysis 

 

On remand Mr. Fanning first argues that “[t]he First Circuit’s Order and Judgment does 

 
not permit the FTC another opportunity to formulate a new Compliance Monitoring sanction 
against Fanning,” so that Paragraph VI of the Commission’s Final Order “should be stricken in 
its entirety and excised from a revised Final Order consistent with the First Circuit’s ruling.”     
Respondent John Fanning’s Response to Order Scheduling Briefing Following Remand, Docket 
No. 9361, at 2 (F.T.C. Apr. 12, 2017) (hereinafter “Fanning Brief”).  The First Circuit’s ruling, 
however, permits the Commission to reinstate an appropriate compliance monitoring provision 
so long as it demonstrates that the relief is reasonably related to Mr. Fanning’s violation.  Indeed, 
the First Circuit has already heard and directly rejected Mr. Fanning’s contentions regarding the 
scope of the remand.  On March 17, 2017, Mr. Fanning filed with the court of appeals a Motion 
for Clarification, in which he (i) argued that “the Court’s Order and Judgment does not permit 
the FTC another opportunity to formulate a new Compliance Monitoring sanction against 
Fanning that the FTC deems appropriate” and (ii) asked the court “to clarify th[e] Court’s 
Opinion and Judgment to express that the Federal Trade Commission on remand shall strike in 
its entirety Paragraph VI - Compliance Monitoring from the revised final administrative order 
that shall enter against John Fanning.”  Petitioner’s Mot. for Clarification, at 4, Fanning v. FTC, 
No. 15-1520 (1st Cir. Mar. 17, 2017).  Four days later, the court of appeals ruled, “Appellant's 
motion to clarify is denied.  The reconsideration of compliance monitoring provisions is 
permissibly within the scope of the remand.”  Order of Court, Fanning, No. 15-1520 (1st Cir. 
Mar. 21, 2017).  In view of the First Circuit’s express holding to the contrary, Mr. Fanning’s 
continued insistence that the court has required the FTC to strike the entire Compliance 
Monitoring provision is unpersuasive. 

 
Mr. Fanning further argues that – if the Commission retains any compliance monitoring 
provision – it must significantly revise both the scope and duration of the requirement.  He urges 
that (i) the required notification regarding affiliations with any new business or employment be 
limited to any new business or employment “that may affect compliance obligations arising 
under this order” and (ii) the compliance monitoring requirement be reduced from ten to three 
years.  Fanning Brief at 3.  Complaint Counsel respond that a robust compliance monitoring 
mechanism that includes notification of new business affiliations and new employment is 
necessary to prevent recidivism.  They argue that the specific facts of this case warrant 
maintaining the original scope of the compliance monitoring provision.  Complaint Counsel’s 
Response to Resp’t’s Briefing on Remand, Docket No. 9361, at 2-3 (F.T.C. May 3, 2017) 
(“Complaint Counsel Brief”).  Complaint Counsel concede, however, that the duration of the 

 

3 

compliance monitoring requirement could be reduced to five years while still providing 
appropriate protection.  Id. at 7-8.   

Requiring individual respondents who have previously controlled or participated in 
 
deceptive conduct to report changes in employment and business affiliation is generally an 
important element in remedying deception.  It has long been recognized that, once the 
Commission has found a respondent to have engaged in deceptive practices, it may impose 
remedies that reach broadly enough “to prevent respondent[] from engaging in similarly illegal 
practices in [the] future.”  FTC v. Colgate Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 395 (1965); cf. FTC v. 
Ruberoid Co., 343 U.S. 470, 473 (1952) (noting, in a price discrimination case, that the 
Commission “must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its 
order may not be by-passed with impunity”) (citations omitted).  Thus, the Commission’s Final 
Order prohibits Mr. Fanning not just from future deceptive use of Jerk.com, but rather from 
misrepresenting the source of any content on a website and the benefits of joining any service.   

 
With an individual respondent, the first step in monitoring such future conduct requires 
knowledge as to where the individual is employed or otherwise conducting business.  Consumer 
complaints regarding deceptive conduct typically identify the allegedly offending company, not 
the individuals behind it.  Having the ability to connect Mr. Fanning to any such consumer 
complaints is a prerequisite for identifying signs of recidivistic deception that would again harm 
consumers.       

 
Numerous courts that have imposed remedial orders for FTC Act violations have 
recognized the contribution of compliance monitoring to achieving remedial goals.2  In 
particular, requiring individual respondents to report changes in their employment or business 
activities has been found “necessary in order for the FTC to monitor Defendants’ compliance,” 
FTC v. Wellness Support Network, Inc., 2014 WL 644749, at *22 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 2014); 
“appropriate to permit the Commission to police” compliance, FTC v. Capital Choice Consumer 
Credit, Inc., 2004 WL 5141452, at *4 (M.D. Fla. May 4, 2004) (internal quotation marks 
omitted) (retaining employment reporting provision in FTC v. Capital Choice Consumer Credit, 
Inc., 2004 WL 5149998, at *52 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 20, 2004)); and “necessary to effectuate 
enforcement of Section 5 of the FTC Act and to deter future violations by the[] Defendants,” 
FTC v. US Sales Corp., 785 F. Supp. 737, 753 (N.D. Ill. 1992).3   Similarly, in FTC v. Direct 

                                                 
2 See, e.g., United States Dep’t of Justice v. Daniel Chapter One, 89 F.Supp. 3d 132, 145-46 (D.D.C. 2015), aff’d, 
650 F. App’x 20  (D.C. Cir. 2016) (monitoring provisions “provide an oversight mechanism to better ensure that the 
defendants do not engage in future recidivism”); FTC v. Alcoholism Cure Corp., 2012 WL 12903173, at *5 (M.D. 
Fla. July 3, 2012) (providing that “[b]road compliance monitoring provisions are necessary to ensure Defendants’ 
compliance”); FTC v. Slimamerica, Inc., 77 F. Supp. 2d 1263, 1276 (S.D. Fla. 1999) (finding monitoring provisions 
“appropriate to permit the Commission to police the defendants’ compliance with the order”). 
3 Other cases in which the courts have imposed or affirmed orders requiring individual defendants to report changes 
in employment status or business activities include POM Wonderful, LLC, 155 F.T.C. 1, 196 (Jan. 10, 2013), aff’d in 
relevant part, POM Wonderful LLC v. FTC, 777 F.3d 478 (D.C. Cir. 2015); FTC v. Think Achievement Corp., 144

Mktg Concepts, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2009), aff’d, 624 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010), the 
trial court characterized monitoring provisions of two orders that, inter alia, required defendants 
to inform the FTC of changes in their employment or business activities as “reasonable and 
necessary to ensure that . . . the FTC has the ability to monitor compliance with the orders and 
prevent future illegal conduct.”4   

Here, the Commission has good reason to require that Mr. Fanning report changes in his 

 
employment or business activities as part of the Commission’s compliance monitoring.  The 
Commission found Mr. Fanning individually liable for multiple deceptive acts that affected 
several aspects of Jerk.com’s website.  See Jerk, LLC, 159 F.T.C. at 917-27 (finding liability for 
misrepresentations concerning (i) website content and (ii) membership benefits).  The 
Commission also found that over time Mr. Fanning had shifted his deceptive activity from 
Jerk.com to a new website and had applied similar techniques to new iterations of his business 
activity.  Id. at 934 (finding that Jerk and Mr. Fanning had moved content from Jerk.com to 
Jerk.org and used automatically generated profiles to populate reper.com).  Of particular 
concern, Mr. Fanning has demonstrated a proclivity to disregard compliance obligations.  For 
example, Paragraph VII of the Final Order required Mr. Fanning and Jerk to file a compliance 
report with the Commission within sixty days after service of the order.  More than two years 
after the Final Order was served,5 no compliance report had been filed.  See Declaration of Kelly 
Ortiz at ¶ 3.6  Mr. Fanning’s failure to file the required compliance report simultaneously 

                                                                                                                                                             
F.Supp. 2d 1013, 1027 (N.D. Ind. 2000); FTC v. Micom Corp., 1997 WL 226232, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 1997);

Injunction and other Equitable Relief against Defendants Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., ITV Direct, Inc., and 
Donald W. Barrett, and Robert Maihos at 21-22, FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. 
Mass. 2009) (Civ. No. 04-11136-GAO), and ¶ IX.A.1 of the proposed Order and Judgment for Permanent Injunction 
and other Equitable Relief against Defendants Allen Stern, King Media, Inc., and Triad ML Marketing, Inc., and

Concepts, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2009) (Civ. No. 04-11136-GAO)).  The First Circuit found the trial 
court’s remedy “appropriate,” 624 F.3d at 18, but the monitoring provisions were not topics of appeal.   
5 The Commission’s Opinion and Final Order was served on March 30, 2015.  See Petition for Review, Fanning v. 
FTC, No. 15-1520, (1st Cir. 2015).  The sixty day period allotted for filing a compliance report ran to May 29, 2015.  
On that day, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit temporarily stayed the Commission’s order pending review of 
Mr. Fanning’s motion for a stay pending appeal.  On July 14, 2015, the court denied the motion and vacated the 
temporary stay.  The temporary stay was in place for only 47 days.    
6 The Ortiz Declaration, dated May 2, 2017, and attached to Complaint Counsel’s Brief, states that in 2015, the 
FTC’s Division of Enforcement sent several letters to Mr. Fanning reminding him of his obligation to submit a 
compliance report.  Ortiz Exhibit B is copy of a September 16, 2015 letter from the Division of Enforcement to Mr. 
Fanning’s attorney, reminding him that Mr. Fanning’s failure to file a compliance report placed him in violation of 
the Final Order.  According to the Declaration, “To date, Complaint Counsel and the FTC’s Division of 

 

5 

establishes a history of disregard for the Final Order’s constraints and deprives the Commission 
of information it needs to protect the public interest.  It illustrates and reinforces the 
Commission’s ongoing need for knowledge of changes in Mr. Fanning’s places of employment 
and business activities in order to monitor his future compliance.       

Mr. Fanning argues that if the FTC refuses to strike his compliance monitoring 

 
obligations in their entirety, the requirement that he report his affiliation with any new business 
or employment should be limited to affiliations “that may affect compliance obligations arising 
under [the Final] [O]rder.”  Fanning Brief at 3.  Mr. Fanning, however has demonstrated a 
pattern of evasiveness about his employment and affiliations that leaves us unwilling to rely 
solely on his discretion as to what affiliations need to be reported.  For example, in his 
September 4, 2014, deposition, Mr. Fanning dodged questions about his then current 
employment, stating that he was “not sure” what type of work he did for compensation or who 
paid him to work.  See CX0092-0012 (exhibit to Complaint Counsel’s Mot. for Summ. 
Decision).  Mr. Fanning also evaded questions about his business affiliations, stating that he was 
“not sure” what the terms “businessman,” and “your business address” meant and whether the 
word “business” covered his transactions.  See CX0092-005-006.  Mr. Fanning further testified 
that he was “not sure” what Jerk LLC was, CX0092-0015, and when asked what Jerk LLC “did 
for a business,” his answer was “I’m not sure what you mean by ‘for a business.’”  CX0092-
0016.   

 
In view of Mr. Fanning’s demonstrated refusal to assign common meanings to common 
terms and his wholesale default on compliance reporting obligations, we cannot rely on him to 
determine what affiliations “may affect compliance obligations” under the Final Order.  Indeed, 
these considerations could arguably justify maintaining the full scope of compliance reporting 
obligations provided by the Final Order.  Nonetheless, we can address the concerns expressed by 
the court of appeals through a revised order provision focused on the types of activities carried 
on by Mr. Fanning and Jerk while limiting new opportunities for verbal gamesmanship.  
Accordingly, we will narrow Paragraph VI of the Final Order to require notification of 
affiliations with any new business or employment “that involves electronic commerce, social 
media, or the online collection or use of consumer data that can be reasonably linked to a specific 
consumer, computer, or other device.”   

With regard to duration of the reporting, courts have recognized that “a sustained period 

 
of monitoring” may sometimes be needed for the FTC “to ensure adequate compliance.”  US 
Sales Corp., 785 F.Supp. at 754.  Here, Complaint Counsel urge that the Final Order’s remedial 
purposes may be served by a five-year requirement.  This corresponds to the five-year period 
endorsed by the court of appeals for other reporting and monitoring provisions of the Final 
Order.  See Fanning, 821 F.3d at 175-76 (affirming five-year requirements for notifications 
                                                                                                                                                             
Enforcement have not received any compliance reports from Respondents John Fanning or Jerk, LLC.”  Ortiz Decl. 
at ¶ 3. 

 

6 

regarding complaints or inquiries and for the maintenance and availability of advertisements and 
promotional materials).  In view of the totality of concerns raised by Mr. Fanning’s conduct, 
including his deceptive conduct in connection with Jerk.com and his failure to file a required 
compliance report, we find a five-year compliance monitoring requirement – running from the 
time of issuance of the Final Order and requiring retroactive notification for the specified 
changes of business or employment that occurred between issuance of the Final Order and the 
effective date of this order – necessary and appropriate for the continued protection of the public.  
Accordingly,  

 

 
 

IT IS ORDERED THAT: 

1. 
 

Section VI of the Commission’s Final Order in this proceeding, issued on March  
13, 2015, is hereby amended to read:

COMPLIANCE MONITORING – JOHN FANNING 

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that John Fanning, for a period of five (5) 

 
years after the date of issuance of this order, shall notify the Commission of the 
discontinuance of his current business or employment, or of his affiliation with 
any new business or employment that involves electronic commerce, social 
media, or the online collection or use of consumer data that can be reasonably 
linked to a specific consumer, computer, or other device.  The notice shall include 
respondent’s new business address and telephone number and a description of the 
nature of the business or employment and his duties and responsibilities.  Unless 
otherwise directed by a representative of the Commission in writing, all notices 
required by this Part shall be emailed to Debrief@ftc.gov or sent by overnight 
courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to: Associate Director for Enforcement, 
Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20580.  The subject line must begin:  In re Jerk,
