COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S MOTION FOR IN CAMERA TREATMENT 

OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Order, Complaint Counsel respectfully file this Motion for In Camera Treatment of Sensitive 

Personal and Financial Information.

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S 

MOTION FOR IN CAMERA TREATMENT OF 

SENSITIVE PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

PUBLIC 

I. 

BACKGROUND 

From at least 2009 through 2012, Respondents have operated Jerk.com, a website that 

invited people to create profiles about others and rate the profiled person a "Jerk" or "not a Jerk." 

The website had as many as 85 million unique pages profiling individuals.  (See CX0151-012; 

CX0153-002)1  According to Complaint Counsel's evidence, approximately 29 million of those 

profiles contained a photo of the profiled subject, an estimated 4.75 million of which were 

photos of children who appeared to be under age  l 0.  (CX0063-002 ~ 9,  ~ 1 0)  Numerous photos 

showed consumers in personal moments with their families, including children in bathtubs and a 

mother nursing her newborn.  (See  CX0259-024-030)  Some profiles also displayed individually 

identifying information about the profiled person, such as address, email address, or phone 

number.  (See CX0048; CX0259) 

On April 7, 2014, the Commission issued a Complaint alleging that Respondents violated 

Section S(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act by falsely representing that the content on 

Jerk.com was created by Jerk.com users and reflected those users' views of the individuals 

profiled on the site (Count I), and that by purchasing a membership to Jerk.com, users would 

obtain additional paid features (Count II).  Fact discovery opened on May 28 and closed on 

November 17.  The evidentiary hearing (or "trial") is set for January 27, 2015.  In preparation for 

1 Complaint Counsel provided an unredacted copy of all the exhibits cited in this brief as part of 
their Final Proposed Exhibit List submitted to the Court and to Respondents on December 12, 
2014.

that hearing, Complaint Counsel respectfully move the Court to grant permanent in camera 

treatment to the sensitive personal and financial information described below. 

ll. 

LEGALSTANDARD 

Under Commission Rule of Practice ("Rule") 3.45(b), the Court shall order that material 

be accorded permanent in camera treatment if the material constitutes "sensitive personal 

information."  16 C.F.R. § 3.45(b).  "Sensitive personal information" includes, but is not limited 

to, "an individual's Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, financial account 

number, credit card or debit card number, driver's license number, state issued identification 

number, passport number, date of birth (other than year), and any sensitive health information 

identifiable by individual, such as an individual' s medical records."  Id.  In addition to the listed 

categories of information, this Court has previously found individuals' names and addresses, 

among other information, to constitute sensitive personal information.  See, e.g., In re LabMD, 

Inc., No. 9357, 2014 WL 2331029, at *1, (FTC May 6, 2014); In re ProMedica Health Sys., No. 

9346, 2011 WL  1896771, at *1 (FTC May 25, 2011).2  In addition to protecting sensitive 

personal information, this Court may "make any other order which justice requires to protect a 

party or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense." 

16 C.P.R.§ 3.3l(d). 

2 Federal courts also require litigants to redact personal data identifiers from public filings.  See, 
e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a); C.D. Cal. R. R. 5.2-1.

III.  ARGUMENT 

A. 

The Court Should Protect Consumers'  ~ensitive Personal Information. 

Complaint Counsel seek permanent in camera treatment for the following categories of 

sensitive personal information of consumers who have complained about Jerk. com or whose 

Jerk. com profiles were captured by FTC staff as part of this investigation:  (1) names, 

(2) photographs, (3) telephone numbers, (4) addresses, (5) e-mail addresses, and (6) online 

usernames.3  The Commission has granted in camera protection to such information in other 

cases.  See,  e.g., In re LabMD, Inc.,  No. 9357,2014 WL 2331029, at *1  (F.T.C. May 6, 2014) 

(according permanent in camera treatment to, inter alia, individuals' names, addresses, dates of 

birth). 

1. 

Consumer Complaints and Testimony 

The first set of documents for which Complaint Counsel seek permanent in camera 

protection consists of consumers'  complaints about Jerk.com, including requests to have profiles 

removed from Jerk. com.  As outlined in Attachment A, 4  these documents include: 

•  Consumer declarations about experiences with Jerk.com, and corresponding attachments, 

submitted by consumers as part of this case (CX0001-CX0040); 

•  Consumer deposition testimony about experiences with Jerk. com, taken as part of this 

case, and corresponding exhibits (CX447- CX0449, CX0450); 

3 Respondents do not oppose permanent in camera treatment for "identification numbers, 
photographs, children's names/identification, emails, and usernames."  Respondents do oppose 
permanent in camera treatment for "names and addresses of witnesses."  Complaint Counsel, 
however, view names and addresses of all consumers as critical sensitive personal information 
warranting protection from exposure, for the reasons explained herein. 

4 Attachment A is a  list of exhibits, and the sensitive personal or financial information contained 
therein, for which Complaint Counsel seek permanent in camera treatment, as well as copies of 
these exhibits containing Complaint Counsel' s proposed redactions. 

4 

PUBLIC 

•  Complaints by consumers about Jerk.com or removal requests to law enforcement 

authorities (CX0550-CX0563, CX565-CX0608, CX0610-CX0620, CX0622-CX0624, 
CX0626-CX0627); to Jerk.com's server provider (CX0403), to Jerk, LLC' s attorney 
(CX0529- CX0545, CX0745-CX0762, CX0764-CX0765, CX0775~CX0776),  and to 
Jerk, LLC' s registered agent (CX0042); 

•  Police incident report about a minor who was profiled on Jerk.com (CX0044);5 and 

•  Complaint Counsel's Final Proposed Exhibit List and Final Witness List.6 

Courts have traditionally accorded strong protection against public disclosure to the 

identities ofvoltmtary witnesses and informants.  See Forrester v.  United States Dep 't of Labor, 

433 F.  Supp. 987, 989 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (recognizing that ''public policy requires that individuals 

may furnish investigative information to the government with complete candor and without the 

understandable tendency to hedge or withhold information out of fear that their names and the 

information they provide will later be open to public view").  Similarly, the Commission's strong 

interest in protecting the personal information of consumer complainants has been widely 

recognized by the courts.7  Personally identifying information in consumers' complaints 

submitted to the FTC, such as the categories listed above, have received protection from 

disclosure in light of the "substantial privacy interest of protecting victims ... from abuse, 

harassment, and embarrassment given the very real risk of their being identified."  Ayuda, Inc.  v. 

5 For this exhibit, which describes the harassment of a thirteen-year old profiled on Jerk.com and 
has been designated by the providing police agency as "Closed to Records," Complaint Counsel 
seek permanent in camera treatment for the entire document. 

6 Both Complaint Counsel's Final Proposed Exhibit List and Final Witness List, submitted on 
December 12, 2014, contain the names of dozens of consumers. 

7 See,  e.g., Lakin Law Firm,  P. C.  v.  FTC, 352 F.3d 1122, 1124 (7th Cir. 2003) ("The personal 
privacy interests of consumers did not disappear when they complained to the FTC."); Carter. 
Fullerton & Hayes LLC v.  FTC, 520 F. Supp. 2d 134, 144-45 (D.D.C. 2007) (upholding the

PUBLIC 

FTC, --- F. Supp. 3d---, 2014 WL 4829574, at *10 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2014) (shielding from 

release under FOIA "personal identifying information in the form of names, addresses, telephone 

numbers, and email addresses" of complainants in the FTC's Consumer Sentinel database).  As 

one district court recently explained, "consumers who are victims, and consequently also are 

whistleblowers and witnesses, face potential backlash if identified in the form of embarrassment, 

becoming a ' mark' for similar schemes in the future, and retribution from the alleged 

wrongdoer."  !d.  The court also cautioned that "[i]f an individual is identified through his or her 

personal information, the release of such information may result in economic and physical 

danger to the accused, as well as potential embarrassment and harassment."  Id. 

The consumer complainants here would face these same risks if their identities linked to 

their complaints are exposed.  Many of these consumers complained about Jerk. com precisely 

because the profiles of them displayed on Jerk. com resulted in harassment, embarrassment, 

professional injury, and threats to personal safety for them and their children.  For example, 

several consumers complained about the threats posed to their professional reputations by the 

Jerk.com profiles ofthem.8  One consumer testified about the negative impact to his small 

business from having been profiled on Jerk.com,9 and another reported that the Jerk.com profile 

FTC's decision to withhold from public review the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of 
consumers who complained to the FTC). 

8 See,  e.g., CX0540 ("The news of this site using my name and image has caused me great deal 
of stress, embarrassment and concern that it may effect [sic] my ability to obtain employment in 
the future"); CX0541  ("having my name connected to this site has caused serious professional 
consequences."). 

9  CX450-24: 18-23 ("So I felt like up until Jerk.com, I had a really --you know, my company 
and myself had a good reputation online.  And then once I saw the Jerk.com thing, it really just,

of her came up during two job interviews. 1° Consumers also reported health problems, 11  as well 
as risks to their safety stemming from being profiled.12  Because an estimated 4.74 million of the 

profiles contained photos of young children  (see CX0063-002 ~ 10),13  consumers have also 

voiced concerns about the safety of their children. 14  One mother reported fears that a past stalker 

would be able to identify her minor daughter,15  while another complained that she was "very 

concerned for my safety and the well-being of my family especially being that of an active duty 

military member." 16  Publicly exposing these consumers' private concerns through this litigation 

would magnify the very same risks about which they had complained, and would thereby 

you know, destroyed that."); CX0038 ~ 4 ("I was concerned about my business reputation so I 
paid jerk.com $30 for an annual membership."). 
1° CX0544-001  ("I am trying to find a job closer to home, as I commute an hour back and forth 
to work and the jerk.com site has come up in two interviews"). 

11  See,  e.g., CX0615-001(reporting having to see several psychologists about the Jerk.com 
posting ofhim); CX0028-002 ~ 8 ("[D]iscovering ajerk.com profile associated with it was 
traumatic and had a negative impact on my health."); CX0036-001  ~ 3 ("I was mortified and 
embarrassed"); CX0536-001  ("I've been having sleepless nights since the day I saw his profile in 
your website and I keep on crying on why there are people who never stop torturing me"). 

12 See,  e.g., CX0538 ("my health and safety are in jeopardy"); CX0535-001  ("I was hoping you 
could help me get a threat to me and my property removed from Jerk.com"); CX0596-001 
("Jerk.com has made a profile for me on their website ... I feel unsafe and victimized by this 
website."); CX0598-001 ("The reason I need my page removed is because my father who is in

PUBLIC 

penalize them for complaining to the agency.  Moreover, since the Jerk.com profiles at issue are 

no longer displayed online, 17 the public release of this information would add further damage by 

prolonging or resurrecting the potential risks to the consumer complainants. 

Conversely, protecting the complainants' identities through in camera treatment would 

avert additional harassment, retaliation, or other personal and professional injury, without 

shielding from public scrutiny the substance of their complaints.  Ordering in camera treatment 

for complainants' sensitive personal information is even more appropriate since this information 

is not relevant to the disposition of this case.  See In re Basic Research, LLC, No. 9318, 2006 

FTC LEXIS  14, at *5-6 (2006) (permitting the redaction of"[i]nformation conceming particular 

[consumers'] names or other [personal] data" because it "is not relevant" (internal citation and 

quotation marks omitted)).  The complainants'  personally identifying information has no bearing 

on either the Complaint's allegations or Respondents ' defenses, and its protection would neither 

prejudice Respondents nor impede the public's ability to understand the arguments or evidence 

presented. 

2. 

Screen and Video Captures of Jerk.com 

The second set of trial exhibits for which Complaint Counsel seek permanent in camera 

protection of sensitive personal information consists of screen and video captures of consumer 

profiles displayed on Jerk.com documented by FTC staffbetween May 2012 and March 2013: 

17 CX0295-023: 18-19 (statement by John Fanning's attorney at the Scheduling Conference: 
"the Web site has been down for some significant amount of time"). 

8 

PUBLIC 

CX004T8-CX0050, CX0053, CX0064-CX0070, CX0259, CX0260-CX0262, CX0265-

CX0271, CX0810. 19 

The consumers recorded in these captures neither knew that their profiles-and the 

sensitive information contained therein-were being documented as part of a law enforcement 

investigation, nor granted their consent to the captures.  These captures took place before the 

filing of the Complaint; they were not intended for public dissemination.  But, since the current 

online version of Jerk.com no longer displays these profiles (see CX0295-023: 18-19), and 

Respondents have not provided Jerk.com profile screenshots or code for the site in response to 

discovery requests (see  CX0297-003 ~~ 5, 6; CX0777-002 ~~ 5, 6), these captures remain the 

best reliable means of presenting to the Court what was displayed on Jerk.com. 

The risks to these consumers from having their identifiable Jerk.com profiles publicly 

released is similar to the risk to the consumer complainants described in section III.A.l.  In light 

of the numerous complaints received by the FTC expressing consumers' emotional distress, 

economic harm, and concerns about safety stemming from having a profile of themselves 

displayed on Jerk. com, it is reasonable to conclude that at least some of the hundreds of 

consumers profiled in the FTC's captures would share the same risks and suffer the same harm if 

their personally identifiable Jerk.com profiles resurfaced because of this action.  Additionally, 

given the large number of profiles captured, it is impracticable for Complaint Counsel to locate 

18 CX004 7 is a declaration by FTC staff describing, inter alia,  screen and video captures of 
Jerk.com that he documented.  The declaration refers to one consumer by name. 

19 For CX0049, CX0050, CX0053, CX0064-CX0070, and CX0260-CX0263, CX0265-
CX0270, which contain the profiles of hundreds of consumers and would be unduly burdensome 
to redact, Complaint Counsel request permanent in camera treatment for the exhibits in their 
entirety. 

9 

PUBLIC 

and interview each of these consumers to determine whether the release of their sensitive 

information in connection with their past Jerk.com profiles would pose a threat.20 

The fact that these captured profiles are no longer publicly accessible further weighs 

against resurrecting them now, in the context of this case.  And, as with the consumer 

complainants, protecting the sensitive information of the consumers in the captured profiles 

would not affect the full and fair disposition of this matter. 

B. 

The Court Should Protect Sensitive Personal Financial Information. 

Complaint Counsel seek permanent in camera treatment for the following categories of 

sensitive personal financial  information: (1) financial account numbers, (2) credit card or debit 

card numbers, (3) financial transaction numbers, ( 4) tax identification numbers, (5) dates of 

birth, and (6) personal signatures.21  As listed in Attachment A, the trial exhibits for which 

Complaint Counsel specifically seek in camera treatment for sensitive personal financial 

information include: 

•  Records and contracts from Immedion, LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Stripe, Inc., 

PayPal, Inc., Harvard Business Services, Inc., Intellius Inc., and a Jerk, LLC consultant, 
(CX0402, CX0411-CX0419, CX0421-CX0425, CX0427-CX0428, CX0494, CX0735, 

2° For this reason, Complaint Counsel also seek a limited exemption for these exhibits from Rule 
3.45(b )'s requirement to "provide, for each piece of such evidence [for which in camera 
treatment is sought] and affixed to  such evidence, the name and address of any person who 
should be notified in the event the Commission intends to disclose in camera information in a 
final decision."  While Complaint Counsel's Attachment B identifies the contact information for 
persons who would be affected by the disclosure of the sensitive personal information described 
in Section III .A.l, providing contact information for the hundreds of persons displayed in the 
FTC's captures of Jerk.com profiles-people with whom Complaint Counsel have had no 
contact-would be overly burdensome. 

21  Respondents do not oppose permanent in camera treatment for "financial information" and 
"identification numbers." 

10 

PUBLIC 

CX0770-773), including a tax form for Jerk, LLC (CX0507);22 

•  Emails and other documents showing financial account, credit card, or debit card 

numbers (CX0091, CX0119, CX0238, CX0240, CX0481, CX0738); 

•  Personal checks (CX0237, CX0241-CX0247); and 

•  Video captures and credit card statements showing FTC staff purchases (CX0050, 

CX0051, CX0053, CX0054, CX0262-CX0264).23 

Rule 3.45  identifies dates of birth, financial account, tax identification, and credit card or 

debit card numbers as sensitive personal information.  Financial transaction numbers and 

personal signatures, while not listed in the Rule, also constitute sensitive personal information 

because they are individually identifiable pieces of information, the disclosure of which would 

expose the associated individual to increased, unnecessary risk of identity theft, fraud, and other 

financial harm.  See, e.g., True the  Vote v.  Hosemann, No. 3:14-CV-532-NFA, 2014 WL 

4273332, at *25-26 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 29, 2014) (recognizing, in light of growing concerns of 

identity theft, the threat posed by combining pieces of personal information to obtain "a host of 

other highly personal information about an individual, particularly in this day of computers with 

vast searching powers").  Absent this litigation, this information would not ordinarily be released 

22  CX0507 is a W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification form that 
contains taxpayer identification information for Jerk, LLC.  Complaint Counsel seeks redaction 
of this exhibit in its entirety.  CX0422, CX0425 and CX0428 are spreadsheets containing 
information about hundreds of financial transactions, including the financial account, credit card, 
and debit card numbers, addresses, and e-mail addresses associated with those transactions. 
Because of the volume of the sensitive financial and personal information in these exhibits, 
Complaint Counsel request permanent in camera treatment of the exhibits in their entirety. 

23 Complaint Counsel seeks permanent in camera treatment for CX0050, CX0051 , CX0053, 
CX0054, CX0262-CX0263 in their entirety because full  redaction of the sensitive financial 
information in those videos would require redaction of that information from each single frame 
of the video.  Given that each video contains thousands of frame, full redaction ofthe 
information would be unduly burdensome. 

11 

PUBLIC 

in the public domain.  Nor would in camera treatment of this information undermine the full and 

fair resolution of this case.  Complaint Counsel therefore requests permanent in camera 

treatment for any sensitive personal financial information disclosed in this matter. 

C. 

A Limited Set of Sensitive Personal Information In The Evidentiary Record 
Should Be Protected. 

In addition to the above requests for in camera treatment of sensitive personal and 

financial information in specific exhibits, Complaint Counsel request permanent in camera 

treatment for the following categories of sensitive personal information contained in any other 

part of this action' s evidentiary record: (I) personal phone numbers, (2) home addresses, (3) 

personal e-mail addresses, and (4) personal online usemames.24  This sensitive information is 

contained in numerous places throughout the record, including deposition testimony (see,  e.g., 

CX0744-25: 4-5), declarations (see,  e.g., CX464-001  ~ 4), and documents (see,  e.g., CX0192, 

CX0306, CX0666).  Several of the witnesses who have provided this information are witnesses 

who worked for or invested in Jerk, LLC.  (See CX0057, CX0089-CX0090, CX0302- CX0303, 

CX0464-CX0465, CX0629-CX0630)  The disclosure of individually identifiable information of 

persons connected with a target of a government enforcement action could subject these persons 

to increased, unnecessary risk of harassment and retaliation.  See Fund for Constitutional Gov 't 

v. Nat'l Archives &  Records Serv., 485 F. Supp. 1, 6 (D.D.C.  1979) (recognizing that "the mere 

connection of an individual's name with a well-known investigation may be both embarrassing 
and damaging"); see also Ayuda, 2014 WL 4829574, at * 10 (describing the threat of "economic 

24 As noted supra n.3, Respondents do not oppose permanent in camera treatment for 
"identification numbers, photographs, children's names/identification, emails, and usemames," 
but do oppose permanent in camera treatment for "names and addresses of witnesses."

PUBLIC 

and physical danger __  . as well as potential embarrassment and harassment" posed by releasing 

personally identifying information of persons "associated with a federal agency's crime 

enforcement effort"). 

Providing a list at this stage of all exhibits containing this sensitive personal information 

is infeasible and unnecessary.  In light of Jerk, LLC's recent reemergence in this action, 

Complaint Counsel cannot predict whether it will come forward with previously undiscovered 

materials to be introduced into evidence.  Nor can Complaint Counsel predict the content of trial 

testimony.  Moreover, the limited categories of information at issue are so clearly recognizable 

that the parties should face no difficulty in identifying them in any given evidentiary 

material.  Recognizing this Court's preference against adjudicating piecemeal requests for in 

camera treatment, see In Re McWane,  No. 9351, Trial Tr. at 2235:6-8 (Sept.  14, 2012), 

Complaint Counsel request that the Court grant in camera treatment to the requested categories 

of personal sensitive information for any material to be introduced into the evidentiary record in 

this matter. 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, Complaint Counsel request that the Court grant this Motion for 

In Camera Treatment.

11      A   Yes.  My full name is 
12      Q   And what is your address?
13      A
14 California 94110.
15      Q   Okay.  And are you represented by counsel?
16      A   No.
17      Q   Now, Teri just administered an oath this 
18 morning.  What does this oath mean to you?
19      A   It means I will be entirely truthful and factual 
20 regarding all the questions you ask me today.
21      Q   Okay.  And it sounds like you understand that a 
22 promise to tell the truth is a promise to truthfully and 
23 also completely answer my questions today?
24      A   Yes.
25      Q   Okay.  So I'm going to be asking you various 

 San Francisco,

1 questions this morning.  If you are not sure of an answer 
2 or you don't have a complete answer, then you must still 
3 answer the question to the extent that you can.  Do you 
4 understand?
5      A   Yes.
6      Q   And if you hear a question and you don't know or 
7 you don't remember the answer necessary to answer the 
8 question, you can say so.  Does that make sense?
9      A   Yes.  Yes.
10      Q   And at some point I may ask a question that is 
11 not clear or that you don't hear or understand.  Will you 
12 agree to let me know if there's anything about my 
13 question that isn't clear or understood by you?
14      A   Yes, I agree.
15      Q   As the day goes on you may also realize that an 
16 earlier answer you gave was inaccurate or was incomplete.
17 If that happens, will you agree to say that you want to 
18 correct or supplement your earlier answer?
19      A   Yes.
20      Q   And you may also want to take a break to use the 
21 restroom to get a drink of water or just to stretch your 
22 legs.  We can take a break as soon as you finish 
23 answering a pending question.  Do you understand?
24      A   Yes.
25      Q   As you can see, the court reporter is recording 

CX0450-005

1 background.  What is your current occupation?
2      A   I'm a hardwood floor contractor.
3      Q   And how long have you been a hardwood floor 
4 contractor?
5      A   Ten years.
6      Q   And are you currently employed with a company or 
7 are you self-employed?
8      A   I am self-employed.  I own my own company.
9      Q   Okay.  And how long have you owned your own 
10 company?
11      A   Ten years.
12      Q   And what is your company?
13      A
14
15      Q   Okay.  And is 
16 San Francisco?
17      A   Yes.
18      Q   You're here to answer questions about your 
19 experience with the website Jerk.com which is the subject 
20 of this suit giving rise to the deposition today.  Did 
21 you look at any documents to prepare for today's 
22 deposition?
23      A   No.
24      Q   Did you look through any e-mails or review --
25      A   Yes, actually, I did look at the three e-mails, 

 based in

1 all that is said here.  Because she can own record our 
2 words, it's important that you say your answers out loud 
3 or verbally when you answer the questions.  Will you 
4 speak all of your answers so that they can be accurately 
5 recorded?
6      A   Yes.
7      Q   And now I'm going to take a few minutes to ask 
8 you some questions to make sure you can listen and answer 
9 my questions today.
10          Have you taken any medications that would affect 
11 your ability to truthfully and completely answer my 
12 questions today?
13      A   No.
14      Q   Do you have any health issues that would prevent 
15 you from truthfully and completely answering my questions 
16 today?
17      A   No.
18      Q   Have you taken any alcohol or drugs?
19      A   No.
20      Q   Did you get enough sleep last night?
21      A   Yes.
22      Q   And is there any other reason why you can't 
23 answer my questions during the deposition today?
24      A   No.
25      Q   Let's begin by talking a little bit about your 

CX0450-006

1 and I believe I looked at a statement that I made to you 
2 guys about a year ago and -- no, two years ago.  But I 
3 looked at that only once about a week ago, so -- yeah, 
4 that's the only documents I've looked at.
5      Q   Okay.  So you looked at e-mails and then you 
6 also looked at the declaration you signed two years ago?
7      A   Exactly.
8      Q   Okay.  Did you speak to anyone about the 
9 deposition today?
10      A   No.
11      Q   I know that we spoke last week briefly -- 
12      A   Oh -- 
13      Q   -- did you speak with anyone --
14      A   Anyone else?
15      Q   Right.
16      A   No.  I only told my girlfriend that I was going 
17 to do this deposition, but that's all.
18      Q   Okay.
19      A   Yeah.
20      Q   And let's now begin to talk about Jerk.com.
21 Now, when did you first learn about the website Jerk.com?
22      A   I found it during a search of my name on Google 
23 search engine.
24      Q   Okay.  And when did you first -- when did you do 
25 that search?

CX0450-007

CX0450-008

9

1      A   I believe that was around December '0- -- 
2 December '11 or January '12.
3      Q   Okay.  So you were doing a search of your name 
4 in December 2012 or January -- or December 2011 or 
5 January 2012 and --
6      A   Yeah -- actually -- wait.  I think I have to 
7 correct that.  Around -- I'm not positive, but maybe 
8 around February or March '12, 2012, I first found 
9 Jerk.com.
10      Q   So I understand, it sounds like you can't quite 
11 remember when --
12      A   I can't, yeah.
13      Q   Okay.  
14      A   Yeah, but thinking about it -- thinking about 
15 it, yeah, I guess it would have been January 2012.
16      Q   Okay.  
17      A   Somewhere in there.
18      Q   Okay.  So around --
19      A   I'm not entirely certain, but I believe that's 
20 when it was.
21      Q   Okay.  And so you said you did a Google search 
22 of your name?
23      A   Yes.
24      Q   And what did you see when you did the Google 
25 search?

 is a jerk."  And 

1      A   I saw a heading "
2 that immediately caught my attention, and so I clicked on 
3 it and it took me to the Jerk.com website.
4      Q   And what did you see when you got to the Jerk 
5 website?
6      A   I saw a profile in my name created -- that had 
7 some statements that were extremely defamatory against me 
8 on that, and the you know, typical Jerk.com format where, 
9 you know, there's a place for a picture, there was some 
10 identifying information about me, like my name, city that 
11 I resided in, my age, an e-mail for me, and then there 
12 was, you know, a place where people could vote if I was a 
13 jerk or if I was not a jerk and give a thumbs up or a 
14 thumbs down, and there was some statements saying really 
15 damaging things, like that I was really stupid and I 
16 think -- I can't remember exactly what they all said.
17          But I think there's one in the e-mail saying 
18 that I had done like way too many drugs or something of 
19 that nature, and just a lot of really, you know, false 
20 and damaging defamatory statements, yeah, uh-huh. 
21      Q   What kind of was your reaction when you first 
22 saw the profile?
23      A   I was concerned that one of my clients, one of 
24 my customers for 
 would see those 
25 statements and potentially not hire me.  And also, you 

CX0450-009

 is a jerk."

1 know, somebody else might see it, a friend or family 
2 member or something.  But mainly -- my main concern was 
3 that I could, you know, potentially lose customers 
4 because of this.
5      Q   Uh-huh.  Now, you said when you first saw the 
6 search results you saw a red line that said, "
 is a 
7 jerk."  Was that in the search results below the Google 
8 search?
9      A   Yes, I believe it was.  It just -- the main 
10 heading was "
11      Q   Okay.
12      A   And then there was some other, you know, 
13 lettering behind that.
14      Q   And do you remember whether it was the first 
15 search result or the second or fifth?
16      A   I believe it was -- it was the first search 
17 result, yeah.  I know it was either the first or the 
18 second, but I know -- I think -- okay, it could have been 
19 the second search result, and then later it jumped up to 
20 the first search result, as I kept checking it and I told 
21 some of my friends about it and then they looked at it, 
22 and I guess, you know, more people looking at it made it 
23 jump up to the first one, I'm assuming.  So I sort of 
24 tried to stop looking at it and encouraged my friends not 
25 to look at it so that there would be less hits to that 

1 entry and then maybe drop down.  Which didn't really work 
2 that much, but a little bit maybe over time.
3      Q   So the first time you looked at, your search 
4 result was either No. --
5      A   It was No. 2.
6      Q   -- it was No. 2?
7      A   I think it was No. 2 honestly, yeah.
8      Q   Okay.  So were you describing your profile and 
9 you said it was kind of a picture -- had a place where 
10 pictures usually are -- 
11      A   Yeah.
12      Q   -- and then other information.  So what 
13 information did it have of kind of you specifically?
14      A   It didn't have a lot.  It had my full name 
15 correctly spelled, that I resided in San Francisco, and 
16 it had my correct age, and it had an e-mail address for 
17 me, and that was it.
18      Q   That was it?
19      A   Uh-huh.
20      Q   And so for the other information with the 
21 comments that you described -- 
22      A   And then the comments, right, right.
23      Q   Okay.  And do you remember if the profile had 
24 any advertisements or links to the site?
25      A   I can't remember.

CX0450-011

CX0450-012

1      Q   Do you remember if there were any votes?
2      A   There were votes, yes.
3      Q   Do you remember what the votes were?
4      A   No.  But they were in -- it was structured in 
5 such a way that if you had more negative votes and 
6 positive votes you were quote, a jerk, and so I had, you 
7 know, the negative votes.  I guess I only had -- when I 
8 initially discovered it, I only had a couple, you know, 
9 negative votes, but it still made me a jerk technically 
10 on the site.
11      Q   Okay.  And by "it made me a jerk on the site," 
12 what do you mean?
13      A   Well, they either -- the heading said, "
14
 is a jerk," and then the other option on some of 
15 the other profiles I looked at was "is not a jerk," so --
16      Q   Okay.
17      A    -- you know, it sort of computerized tallied up 
18 your votes and then decided from, you know, the vote 
19 tally if you were a jerk or you weren't according to the 
20 website.
21      Q   Okay.  So for your profile then, the profile 
22 labeled "
23      A   Uh-huh.
24      Q   And did your profile have any other information?
25 Did it have a phone number?

 is a Jerk"?

PUBLIC

14

 

1      A   No.
2      Q   Did it have an e-mail address?
3      A   It did.
4      Q   And what was the e-mail address on -- 
5      A   It was an e-mail address that didn't belong to 
6 me, and that e-mail address was 
 
7
8      Q   Okay.  On so that e-mail address wasn't actually 
9 your -- 
10      A   It was not my e-mail address, no.
11      Q   You mentioned that you saw, you know, a few of 
12 the other profiles.  Did you look at anything else on the 
13 website the first time you visited?
14      A   Yeah, I looked at a lot.  One of the things I 
15 looked at was whether or not I could be removed, and 
16 there was a statement saying, you know, this was a public 
17 forum and that people were able to vote and that there 
18 was -- it was up to -- sort of up to the public I guess 
19 to vote, and so they wouldn't remove anything because it 
20 was a -- just whatever the public decided was the truth 
21 and it needed to stay on the Internet.
22          So that sort of disturbed me because I really 
23 wanted the information off of the site.  I felt it wasn't 
24 true and -- so -- 
25      Q   Right.  Do you remember checking out any other 

CX0450-013

CX0450-014

15

16

1 sections of the website?
2      A   Yeah, I did.  I visited the site quite a few 
3 times after that and I checked it out thoroughly and 
4 looked at other peoples' profiles, looked at the rules of 
5 the site, and just pretty much clicked on everything that 
6 was available, although I don't remember all of what that 
7 was, but I did, I thoroughly examined the website, yes.
8      Q   Do you remember -- you said you've looked at the 
9 rules on the website.  Do you remember what the rules 
10 said?  Or what --
11      A   Only vaguely, and I remember them vaguely 
12 stating that I would not be able to remove the -- that no 
13 one could be removed from Jerk.com and -- but it also 
14 said stuff like you could vote and you could have, you 
15 know, a say in Jerk.com, and there was also a section I 
16 think where I could join the website, pay a fee, and at 
17 that point I would have a chance to register my, you 
18 know, feelings about the -- my profile -- I would have 
19 access to my profile somehow, I believe it said, and -- 
20 so yeah.
21      Q   Now, when you saw your profile, did you think 
22 someone had created the profile of you?
23      A   I did, yes.
24      Q   And who did you think had created the profile?
25      A   Well, at the time I had a dispute with a client 

1 with a -- you know, I think it was about $1,600, and then 
2 I had found out that that client had also not paid a 
3 large number of other contractors and they -- the 
4 other -- I had contacted the other contractors and they 
5 all sort of wanted to have like a class action suit 
6 against this client.  And so I was sort of involved in 
7 that at that time, and I felt like it was potentially 
8 that client putting negative comments on the Internet to 
9 try and intimidate me and they were using the Jerk.com 
10 platform to intimidate me legally.  That's what I 
11 initially thought.
12      Q   Did you think it was anyone -- could have been 
13 anyone else?
14      A   Yes, I did consider that it was my landlord or a 
15 neighbor that was also -- I was having some difficulties 
16 with, uh-huh.
17      Q   Okay.
18      A   Yeah.
19      Q   And were there any specific reasons you thought 
20 it was those two?
21      A   Only because I had no other conflict with anyone 
22 and couldn't imagine anyone else saying such, you know, 
23 negative statements about me, and I had -- those were the 
24 only two people I could think of that would do such a 
25 thing, you know.  Yeah.

CX0450-015

CX0450-016

17

1      Q   Now, you mentioned that you had visited the 
2 website quite a few times.  Can you estimate, you know, 
3 just about how many times you visited the site?
4      A   That's hard to say.  In total, from the time 
5 that I first discovered it --
6      Q   Right.
7      A    -- until I found that it was -- my name was 
8 taken off of the site, it must have -- it would be -- 
9 it's a hard number to estimate.  I would say a hundred -- 
10 around a hundred roughly.
11      Q   Okay.
12      A   Uh-huh, yeah.
13      Q   And do you remember how long you spent kind of 
14 on each visit?  Do you remember on your first visit, how 
15 long you were on the website?
16      A   No, I can't remember exactly the times, you 
17 know.
18      Q   Could it have been like five minutes or more 
19 like half an hour?
20      A   Maybe initially, when I first saw it, I may have 
21 spent, you know, five or ten minutes.
22      Q   Okay.
23      A   And then I would -- I was like upset and maybe 
24 talked to my friends about it, and then got back on it 
25 and spent another 20 minutes or something.

PUBLIC

18

1      Q   Okay.
2      A   I remember initially -- when I first initially 
3 saw it, I checked it frequently, like is this -- what's 
4 going on?  And then I started researching it on Google 
5 and found that other people were having issues with the 
6 site and, you know, started trying to research a way that 
7 I could get my name taken off the site and things like 
8 that.
9      Q   And if you were to estimate how long you spent 
10 doing all that -- doing the research and visiting the 
11 site, about how --
12      A   Oh, yeah, that's quite a bit of time I spent.
13 Yeah, I did a lot of research.  I read -- there was a lot 
14 of information on a Google forum where people -- it was 
15 like a thread and people were sharing their experience 
16 with Jerk.com, and some were saying how unethical it was 
17 and others were saying, Oh, well, whatever, you should 
18 just accept it, and others were saying I was able to get 
19 myself removed because I joined Jerk.com and I paid the 
20 fee and took my name off, and other people were saying 
21 you could write Google and ask for a take-down notice and 
22 they would remove your name.
23          And so I just -- I spent hours and hours 
24 actually researching that, I did, and I really felt like 
25 it threatened my business, and so it was important to me 

CX0450-017

CX0450-018

19

20

1 to get that off, yeah.  I spent a lot of time, uh-huh.
2          And I tried a lot of things, I mean, as 
3 evidenced by those three letters, I tried twice with 
4 Google to send them take-down notices and complaints and 
5 stuff like that, and I sent a thing to John Fanning, 
6 which I figured probably wouldn't work but I was going to 
7 try it anyway, just in case.
8          Yeah, so I did a lot.  And then I tried to join 
9 Jerk.com at least twice, I believe, and maybe more than 
10 that, uh-huh.
11      Q   Okay.  Would you estimate that it was, you know, 
12 like ten hours that you spent, or more like 50 hours 
13 or --
14      A   Yeah, more like 50.  50 plus, yeah.
15      Q   Okay.  Now, you said you probably visited, you 
16 know, a hundred --
17      A   Maybe, you know -- sorry to interrupt you.
18 Maybe more like 70 hours altogether I put into it.
19      Q   Okay.  The 70 hours including the times you 
20 visited and --
21      A   Yeah, I spent a lot of time researching, you 
22 know, and then in talking to people and just, you know, 
23 looking at the site, going back, checking.  Then a lot of 
24 times I would try and check Google, but I wouldn't go to 
25 the site exactly, but I would just see if it was still on 

1 the Google search engine.  I spent a lot of time, yeah.
2      Q   Okay.  And during the times you were checking, 
3 do you remember where you were in the -- kind of the 
4 search results?
5      A   Yeah, it fluctuated.  You know, I think it 
6 started off where I was like No. 2 when I first noticed 
7 it, and then as I looked at it more -- I kept looking at 
8 it, and then I sort of I guess created my own problem 
9 because I had so many hits on it because I looked at it 
10 so much, then it moved up one, and then the day that 
11 happened, I was pulling my hair out when I realized what 
12 I had done.  So at that point I started trying to look at 
13 it more covertly, you know.
14          So, yeah, and then I also had told my friends, 
15 Just don't look at it.  At one point I had told a good 
16 friend of mine about it and she had told her mother, 
17 who's, you know, fond of me, and her mother got on the 
18 site and wrote a rebuttal to the negative comment saying 
19 that I was a good person and these people were really 
20 unethical for using this site and for misrepresenting me 
21 on the site.  So there was one, you know, positive 
22 comment from her on the site.
23          So then I asked my friends to just stop 
24 accessing the site because I moved up to No. 1, so --
25      Q   So from the time you saw the profile until the 

CX0450-019

CX0450-020

21

1 time that you saw it was no longer up in the search 
2 results, it was always one of the top one or two?
3      A   No, after sometime -- I would say maybe back 
4 in -- when would that be?  So I saw it in 2012 -- I would 
5 say it dropped down a few notches in maybe that summer -- 
6      Q   Okay.
7      A   -- to like three or something like that.  And I 
8 was -- you know, I really felt positive about that.  And 
9 then I think I tried to also see if I could get hits to 
10 other, you know, sites that had my name so it would bump 
11 it even farther down.  So that's more time that I didn't 
12 even think of, you know, doing that.
13          And then over -- you know, it just gradually 
14 dropped down to where I started noticing it was at like 
15 No. 6 towards the end, and No. 7, quite a bit down from 
16 there.  And that made me happy because it wasn't the 
17 first thing that people would see when they Googled me.
18 I was still upset that it was on the search engine.
19          And then I think finally this year, around maybe 
20 April or May, I'm not positive, I noticed that it was no 
21 longer up.  And then I went to the site and I saw that my 
22 name wasn't -- or actually, I think I got an e-mail from 
23 Sarah Schroeder from the FTC saying that they had made 
24 some progress or something in the case, and that's when 
25 I -- I had kind of given up looking at it at that point, 

PUBLIC

22

1 and then I looked again and I saw that it was no longer 
2 there.  And I was really happy about it, yeah.
3      Q   So it sounds like the search results 
4 fluctuated -- 
5      A   They did.
6      Q   -- but it still stayed on the first page of the 
7 search results?
8      A   For a long time, yeah, it stayed -- I believe 
9 the whole time it was on the first page.  I don't think I 
10 ever remember seeing it going to the second page.
11 Possibly towards the end, but I'm not positive.
12      Q   Okay.  So before you saw the Jerk profile and 
13 the Jerk headlines in the search result, had you done a 
14 Google search of your name before?
15      A   Yes.
16      Q   Okay.  And what did those results look like?
17      A   The No. 1 entry on Google prior to the Jerk.com 
18 incident was for my business, 
  And then 
19 I think there was another one that was for some donation 
20 work that I'd done, and then -- let me see, what were the 
21 other ones?  I can't really remember.  Yeah, I'm not 
22 sure.
23      Q   So the result you said --
24      A   Oh, yeah, there was one also I believe for some 
25 stuff I'd written in a trade journal for hardwood floors.

CX0450-021

CX0450-022

24

 --

1 The Hardwood Flooring Magazine.  That was another Google 
2 entry, yeah.
3      Q   So it sounds like you had -- you said there was 
4 one for your 
5      A   Yeah.
6      Q   -- for your company?
7      A   Right.
8      Q   And then for a trade social article you wrote on 
9 flooring?
10      A   Yes.
11      Q   And then for your donation work?
12      A   Yes, Global Garden, was the name of that entry.
13      Q   Okay.  So at least two of those had to do with 
14 your work?
15      A   That's correct.
16      Q   Okay.  And for the 
17 was that -- do you remember what that link was to?
18      A   Yes, it was to the website Yelp.com.
19      Q   Okay.  And what was on the Yelp.com website?
20      A   All of my -- it said Yelp and it had five stars 
21 and all of my reviews that were, you know, posted by my 
22 customers.
23      Q   So was it a review?
24      A   Yeah, Yelp is a review site and, yeah -- and 
25 there were just -- it just enables people to review 

 entry, 

 

 and for 

1 businesses, and there was, you know, quite a few reviews.
2 There's some reviews of my business on Yelp.
3      Q   Right.  And did the review also mention -- did 
4 they mention your name?
5      A   Yes, they did, uh-huh.
6      Q   So they were for 
7
8      A   Yes, uh-huh.
9      Q   And you said there were five stars for the 
10 review?
11      A   Uh-huh, yes.
12      Q   And so did you have -- I mean, were the reviews 
13 positive?
14      A   They were all positive, yes.
15      Q   And so you said that the top one for the company 
16 in the search result before you saw the Jerk.com was for 
17 Yelp?
18      A   Yes.  So I felt like up until Jerk.com, I had a 
19 really -- you know, my company and myself had a good 
20 reputation online.  And then once I saw the Jerk.com 
21 thing, it really just, you know, destroyed that.  And so 
22 they say for any business, your online reputation is 
23 really important right now, so I was concerned.
24      Q   Right.  Was your kind of online -- were you 
25 concerned about your online reputation in the 2012 -- or 

CX0450-023

CX0450-024

25

1 that time when you first saw the profile?
2      A   Yes, uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, I felt like I had a 
3 great online reputation until I saw that, uh-huh.
4      Q   And do you have -- do you get customers from 
5 your online reviews?
6      A   All my customers from Yelp, pretty much.  I 
7 would say 97 percent of them come from Yelp.
8      Q   Okay.
9      A   Uh-huh, yeah.  They all come from online.
10      Q   Okay.  And so did a lot of your customers come 
11 from online in 2012 -- 
12      A   Yes.
13      Q   -- as well?
14      A   Yes.
15      Q   Okay.  So were you concerned that your customers 
16 would then see the Jerk.com search result?
17      A   Yes, absolutely.
18      Q   And sometimes it was above the Yelp.com search 
19 result?
20      A   Yes.
21      Q   Do you think that the Jerk.com -- do you know if 
22 it affected your business, the Jerk.com profile?
23      A   Well, I can't say definitively, but I believe it 
24 did, yes.
25      Q   And why do you think that?

PUBLIC

26

1      A   Well, I think that -- a lot of my floor jobs are 
2 a considerable sum of money.  I have jobs sometimes that 
3 are 30, 40, $50,000 for the net cost, and I feel like if 
4 you're looking up someone online to hire them and you 
5 don't know really know them before you give them $50,000, 
6 you might research them a little bit.  And so I felt like 
7 at that time, you know, it was quite probable that some 
8 of my customers would look on Google to sort of check out 
9 my reputation and might see the Jerk.com thing.  So -- 
10 yeah.
11      Q   Uh-huh.  When you found your profile, how was 
12 your business at the time?  Was it -- you know, were you 
13 having a lot of customers?  You said at that time a lot 
14 of customers also came from online reviews.
15      A   Yeah, my business was doing well.  It was doing 
16 really well.  There was a recession at the time and a lot 
17 of, you know, my colleagues were having a lot of trouble, 
18 but I was actually doing -- considering the construction 
19 climate, I was doing pretty well, uh-huh.  I managed to 
20 stay in business throughout all of that and some of my 
21 colleagues didn't.
22      Q   Okay.  And so did you -- you said you think the 
23 profile affected your business.  Did any customers tell 
24 you, or did anyone come up to you and say, "I saw" --
25      A   That's a good question.  I'm not certain about 

CX0450-025

CX0450-026

27

28

1 that question.
2      Q   Okay.  
3      A   I can't say for sure.  I have to think about 
4 that.  I can't remember anyone -- well -- yeah, I'm just 
5 going to leave it I'm not certain about that.
6      Q   Okay.  
7      A   It's possible.  It's possible, uh-huh.  I do 
8 recall I think having at least one conversation with a 
9 customer about it and asking them if they weren't hiring 
10 me because of it, or something of that nature.  But I'm 
11 not sure that any customer came to me and said, "Look, 
12 we're not hiring you because we saw this."
13      Q   Okay.  
14      A   So -- yeah.
15      Q   So you can't remember, but maybe --
16      A   I can't remember.
17      Q   But do you remember if you talked to any 
18 customers about the Jerk.com profile?
19      A   I believe that I may have asked two of them 
20 about it, yes.  If they had seen that or if it had -- or 
21 I told them, you know, not to factor in when they were 
22 considering hiring me, or something like that, uh-huh.
23      Q   Do you remember what their reactions were?  Do 
24 you remember if they had seen it?
25      A   I think that both of the ones I talked to 

1 said -- well, I think I remember one -- one of 'em 
2 saying, "I wouldn't base my decision on that," on, you 
3 know, "negative comments from your website" -- you know, 
4 "on another website."  And then I don't remember the 
5 other reaction.
6      Q   Okay.  And usually when, you know, people come 
7 to you through Yelp, do they tell you that, "Oh, I saw a 
8 great review of you on Yelp"?  Is that how you know they 
9 came through Yelp?
10      A   Quite frequently, yes.
11      Q   Now -- so you mentioned that, you know, the Yelp 
12 result was on top for awhile, and then you saw the 
13 Jerk.com profile, and at that time the Jerk.com 
14 profile -- when you first saw it, the search result was 
15 No. 2?
16      A   Yes.
17      Q   And then at some point you said that the Jerk 
18 search result, or the Jerk link was the -- became the top 
19 search result?
20      A   Yes.
21      Q   Do you -- so that then it was above the Yelp 
22 search result?
23      A   Yeah.
24      Q   Do you remember how long the Jerk link was above 
25 the Yelp?

CX0450-027

CX0450-028

29

1      A   No, I don't remember, no.
2      Q   Was it for kind of the majority of the time 
3 between when you found it -- found your -- the Jerk link 
4 to when you noticed the link wasn't up?
5      A   If I had to estimate, I would say it was 
6 probably like that from, you know, February 2012 until 
7 maybe the fall of 2012, or midsummer, something like 
8 that.  But I'm really not sure.  I'm not sure, yeah.
9      Q   Okay.  But it was -- you feel like --
10      A   It was a considerable amount of time.
11      Q    -- like it was a few months?
12      A   A few months at least.  That's a great way to 
13 put it, uh-huh.
14      Q   So at least two or three months?
15      A   Yeah, I would say so.
16      Q   I'm going to ask for a break.  
17      A   Okay.
18              (Recess.)
19 BY MS. FANG:  
20      Q   We're back on the record.  
21      A   Okay, great.
22      Q   You're still under oath.  
23          So, you know, before we took a break we were 
24 just talking about the different search results.  
25      A   Yeah.

PUBLIC

30

1      Q   Kind of in your view, do you think that the Jerk 
2 search results and Yelp search results were competing for 
3 your customers' attention?
4      A   Yes, absolutely.  Particularly when they were 
5 right next to each other.  I was really concerned for 
6 that, uh-huh.
7      Q   And then -- so because of your concern, did 
8 you -- you tried to get your profile on Jerk.com removed?
9      A   Yes.
10      Q   Now, what were some of the ways you tried to get 
11 your profile removed?  Did you e-mail the website 
12 Jerk.com?
13      A   Yes.
14      Q   And how did you e-mail them?
15      A   Well, I had read on the -- one of the Google 
16 forums I believe that if you wrote them a e-mail saying 
17 that you were going to file a defamation suit against 
18 them, there was a chance they would remove you.  So I 
19 tried that, not thinking that it would work for sure, but 
20 it was worth a try, because basically I was kind of 
21 desperate to get it removed.
22      Q   And do you remember who you contacted?
23      A   Yeah, on the Google forum there was a e-mail 
24 address for John Fanning, and I sent that e-mail to John 
25 Fanning.  And somebody had written on the forum, if you 

CX0450-029

CX0450-030

31

32

1 write John Fanning at this e-mail address and threaten to 
2 have a defamation suit, you will get this removed, or 
3 might get this removed.  And I thought, well, it doesn't 
4 sound likely, but it's worth a try, so I did do it.
5      Q   Okay.  Did you think that John Fanning was 
6 responsible for the website?
7      A   I mean, I didn't know.  I read a lot about it 
8 and apparently he was, you know, definitely involved in 
9 it, and I don't know if he was completely responsible or 
10 if he had partners.  I think there was some mention of 
11 that in the stuff I read.  But it sounded like he was one 
12 of the key players in the website, but I wasn't positive.
13      Q   Did you find any other, you know, e-mail 
14 addresses or names that -- to contact?
15      A   I'm not sure.  It seems like there were some, 
16 yes, but I can't recall that at the time.  I don't know 
17 exactly who that would have been.  I know they talked 
18 about his wife and they talked about I think another 
19 business partner or something like that.  I don't 
20 remember who that was.  But there was a lot of 
21 information about the site on Google, uh-huh.
22      Q   On the Google forum?
23      A   Google forum, and other sites too.  I can't 
24 remember the names of the other sites.  But there was a 
25 lot on Google forums.  I remember that name, but there 

1 were several other sites that had information on Jerk.com 
2 as well.
3      Q   And how did you decide to contact the John 
4 Fanning?  You know, e-mail address?  Did that name come 
5 up a few times or --
6      A   Yeah, I saw the John Fanning name -- in pretty 
7 much most of my research about Jerk.com I saw that name 
8 come up.  And then there was one entry on the Google 
9 forum giving his address and saying that you have this 
10 chance of having it removed if you wrote this address, so 
11 I did that, uh-huh.
12      Q   Okay.  So it sounds like in the research that 
13 did you, the John Fanning name came up more often?
14      A   It did come up a lot, yes.
15      Q   Okay.
16      A   Yeah, more than any other name for sure, yeah.
17 It -- usually what I would read is that he was 
18 responsible for the site or he was in charge of it or he 
19 owned it, something of that nature, uh-huh.
20      Q   And so you -- did you e-mail him?
21      A   I did, uh-huh.
22      Q   And did you get a response to your e-mail?
23      A   No.
24      Q   And did you try any other -- did you contact 
25 anyone else about removing the Jerk.com profile?

CX0450-031

CX0450-032

33

1      A   Yes, I contacted Google.  On two occasions I had 
2 tried.  Both times it didn't work.
3      Q   And what was your request to Google?
4      A   I asked Google to remove the entry, and there 
5 was something I had read in my research about taking a 
6 take-down notice to Google.  I'm not sure exactly what 
7 the process was for that, but I followed that process, 
8 and that was basically my request with Google.  And they 
9 had -- they had different questionnaires that you could 
10 ask and you'd click a button, it would lead you this next 
11 part, you know, sort of a menu, and so they could get 
12 your -- you know, a grievance or your comments or 
13 whatever.
14          And I went through that whole process, and I 
15 received a response from Google saying that they weren't 
16 going to take the entry down.  And then I was really 
17 frustrated when that happened and so, you know, I 
18 continued to do more research on such, and I thought, 
19 well -- later, I'm not sure what the dates were between 
20 that, but I thought, Well, you know, let me try that 
21 again.  Because I was really kind of just grasping at 
22 straws trying anything to get it off the site because I 
23 really felt like it was going to impact my business, 
24 uh-huh.
25      Q   Did you contact -- well, I'm curious, why did 

PUBLIC

34

1 you decide to contact Google?  Was it to remove it from 
2 their search results?
3      A   Yes.  Yes.  Hopefully that they would, you 
4 know -- I had -- I think -- I don't remember exactly, but 
5 I believe it was for two reasons.  One, that they would 
6 remove it from the search results, and two, that they 
7 would consider removing the site entirely.
8          But I'm not sure if that's right or not, but I 
9 believe that's what my intentions were, uh-huh, yeah.
10      Q   Okay.
11      A   Definitely the first, the former.  I was 
12 definitely hoping they would remove it from the search 
13 engine results.  That was my main goal.
14      Q   And that's because you were concerned about -- 
15 of your customers searching Google and seeing that search 
16 result?
17      A   Yes, exactly.
18      Q   And did you receive a --
19      A   Actually, I also felt like it was really a sort 
20 of unethical site and felt, you know, that there were a 
21 lot of other people in my condition -- in my situation.
22 And I was also feeling that it just was unethical and I 
23 was trying to tell Google, Hey, take this off for a lot 
24 of people.  I read that children were being harassed 
25 because of the site.  So I had that intention as well, 

CX0450-033

CX0450-034

35

36

1 uh-huh.
2      Q   And did you get a response from Google?
3      A   I did, uh-huh.
4      Q   And what was -- you said you contacted Google 
5 twice.  What was their response?
6      A   I don't remember exactly.  It's in the e-mails 
7 that I gave you.  I haven't looked at 'em really closely, 
8 but I do remember it was that they weren't going to take 
9 the citation off of their search engine, so -- but I 
10 don't know exactly what they said.
11          MS. FANG:  I'm going to hand to Mr. 
12 we've marked as CX0447-001.
13              (FTC Exhibit CX 447 marked.)
14 BY MS. FANG:
15      Q   Mr. 
16 marked as CX-447.  Do you recognize this document?
17      A   Yes.
18      Q   What is it?
19      A   It's my response from the Google team to my 
20 request that they remove the Jerk.com citation about me.
21      Q   And is this document the e-mail that you brought 
22 in this morning?
23      A   Yes.
24      Q   And so you said -- what is the date of the 
25 e-mail?

 I'm showing you what we've now 

 what 

 the e-mail address 

1      A   The date is March 7th, 2012.
2      Q   And it's from?
3      A   It's from the Google team.  In brackets it says, 
4 "Removals at Google.com."
5      Q   And it's addressed to?
6      A   It's addressed to my e-mail address, 
7
8      Q   And is 
9 that you use?
10      A   Yes, it's my primary e-mail address.
11      Q   And was it your e-mail address in 2012?
12      A   Yes.
13      Q   And do you use it for business and for 
14 personnel?
15      A   Yeah.  Mainly I guess personal, but both, yes.
16      Q   Okay.  Mostly person- --
17      A   Mostly personal, yes.
18      Q   And does this document include kind of your 
19 earlier message to Google?
20      A   Yes, it includes --
21      Q   Or your earlier -- 
22      A   It includes my -- some of my earlier message.  I 
23 guess -- the original message follows, and then it says I 
24 had e-mailed them, "Subject:  Your Request to Google, 
25 Date," so it's sort of coded, but it does contain my 

CX0450-035

CX0450-036

37

1 original message, yes.
2      Q   So it looks like there's a lot of different 
3 fields in the e-mail that looks like -- could this have 
4 been the form that you filled out to submit the request 
5 to them and these are the entries?
6      A   I think so.  This is the form I was speaking of 
7 earlier I believe, yeah.  Yeah, I think this is their, 
8 you know, just computer code recognizing my responses to 
9 their form process, it looks like.
10      Q   Uh-huh.  And so what was your kind of original 
11 request to Google, or your form that you submitted to 
12 Google?  What was your main complaint?
13      A   I think I was asking that it be removed because 
14 it was defamatory statements, and I was trying to follow 
15 that take-down notice procedure that I had read about in 
16 the Google forums.
17      Q   Lower on the page, I think there's a section 
18 under the legalother_explain category, it says, "This 
19 page contains defamatory statements about me.  This page 
20 contains malicious false statements about me.  The page 
21 says Quote:  This guy is insane, pure and simple.  This 
22 is a false defamatory statement under U.S. law."
23      A   Uh-huh.
24      Q   Do you remember writing that to Google?
25      A   I do, yes, I remember writing that.

38

 is a Jerk.'  This is also a 

1      Q   Lower on that same entry, it says, "The page 
2 also says '
3 defamatory statement."
4      A   Uh-huh.
5      Q   When you wrote this, did you think that, you 
6 know, someone thought you were a Jerk from the --
7      A   Yes.  I guess I would have to answer yes.  I 
8 mainly just felt like someone was using the forum to 
9 harass me, they had a legal agenda against me or 
10 something.
11      Q   And then, as you said, Google's response is on 
12 top and it looks like they wrote on March 7th, "We have 
13 received your legal request."
14      A   Uh-huh.
15      Q   And that due to -- well, "We receive many such 
16 complaints each day" and "your message is in our queue 
17 and we'll get to it as quickly as our workload permits."
18      A   Uh-huh, I see, okay.  Right.
19      Q   And you didn't get any additional responses to 
20 that after --
21      A   I don't know.
22      Q   Okay.  Now I'm going to hand to you what I've 
23 marked as CX0448-001.  
24              (FTC Exhibit CX 448 marked.)

1      Q   Do you recognize this document?
2      A   Yes.
3      Q   What is it?
4      A   It's a e-mail to John Fanning from me that I -- 
5 this is what I spoke about earlier.  It was me advising 
6 him that I would file a defamation site against Jerk.com, 
7 please remove my name -- and a request to remove my name 
8 from the site.  And as I mentioned earlier, I had read 
9 that that may work in getting you removed from the site.
10      Q   And so this is an e-mail -- what's the date on 
11 the e-mail?
12      A   March 7th.
13      Q   And this is from your 
14 address?
15      A   Yes.
16      Q   To 
17      A   Correct.
18      Q   Okay.  And so then this is an e-mail from you to 
19 John Fanning?
20      A   Yes, that's correct.
21      Q   Or to that e-mail address.  And is the 
22
23 Google forum that you mentioned earlier?
24      A   Yes.
25      Q   And did you get -- were you planning to file a 

 address the address you found on the 

?

1 defamation suit against Jerk.com?
2      A   Honestly, I was thinking that I wouldn't need to 
3 and that I would try this -- somebody said by making that 
4 statement, it would get you removed.  So I wasn't 
5 planning on doing that.
6      Q   So you really wanted him -- whoever received 
7 this to remove the profile though?
8      A   Yeah.  Although, I mean, if possible I would 
9 have, yeah.  I'm not sure if I remember if they said that 
10 I could do that easily or not, but -- I don't know.  I 
11 mean -- I think mainly -- I really don't recall, but I 
12 think mainly I was just following the script that I had 
13 read on the Google forum that would get me removed from 
14 the thing.  Say, "please remove my name from the site," 
15 so --
16      Q   Okay.
17      A   Yeah, uh-huh.
18      Q   Okay.  And -- so when you wrote, you just 
19 wanted -- you saw that you could write to this e-mail 
20 address and request removal and you just wanted to try 
21 it --
22      A   Uh-huh.
23      Q    -- to see if it could get your information 
24 removed?
25      A   Yes.

CX0450-039

CX0450-040

41

1      Q   And did you receive a response to this e-mail?
2      A   No.
3      Q   And from kind of your time looking at the Google 
4 forum, did it seem like other people were having the same 
5 problem that you -- or concern that you had with --
6      A   Yes, it seemed like there were a large number of 
7 people that were having similar problems.
8      Q   Okay.  And, you know, did it seem like a lot of 
9 people were also trying to find ways to contact --
10      A   Yes, absolutely.
11      Q    -- Jerk -- and can you -- you know, do you have 
12 a sense of how many people might have also been in your 
13 same situation?
14      A   Oh, thousands.
15      Q   Thousands?
16      A   Yeah.
17      Q   Okay.
18      A   Easily, yeah.
19      Q   Okay.  And so this is from looking at the forums 
20 and all the different posts?
21      A   That was the impression I got, yeah.  Tens of 
22 thousands I would imagine.
23      Q   Okay.  And now, Mr. 
24 you a document that we have marked as CX0449.001.
25          Oh, before I move to this one, for the last one, 

 I'm going to show 

PUBLIC

42

1 the CX-448, I just want to make sure, that's the document 
2 that you brought in this morning?
3      A   Yes, it is.
4      Q   Okay.  Now I'm going to show you CX0449.001?
5           (FTC Exhibit CX 449 marked.)
6          THE WITNESS:  Okay.
7 BY MS. FANG:
8      Q   Do you recognize this document?
9      A   Yes, I do.
10      Q   What is the document?
11      A   It's a response from the Google team, 
12 Googleremovals@Google.com, to me at my e-mail, 
13
14 is a US site regulated by US law.  Google provides access 
15 to publicly available webpages, but does not control the 
16 content of any of the billions of pages currently in the 
17 index.  Given this fact, pursuant to Section 230(c) of 
18 the Communications Decency Act, Google does not remove 
19 any allegedly defamatory material from our search 
20 results.  You will need to work directly with the 
21 webmaster of the page in question to have this 
22 information removed or changed.  If you haven't yet 
23 worked with the webmaster, please visit Google," 
24 et cetera, et cetera.  "Once the material has been 
25 modified on the site in question, Google's search results 

 and I guess it says, "Google.com

44

1 will automatically reflect this change after we next 
2 crawl the site.  We are sorry we cannot assist you 
3 further at this time.  Regards, The Google Team."
4      Q   And what is the date of the e-mail?
5      A   May 13th, 2012.
6      Q   Okay.  So in May 2012, were you still trying to 
7 contact Google to get the profile removed?
8      A   Apparently so, yes.
9      Q   And does that e-mail contain your original 
10 request to Google?
11      A   No, this is a separate request to Google that I 
12 made -- it appears this is a separate request that I made 
13 on May 13th.  I believe my original -- according to these 
14 documents, was on March 8th.  So it appears that, you 
15 know, a couple months later I was yet trying again to 
16 have it removed from Google and they were telling me no, 
17 that they couldn't.  So -- yeah.
18      Q   So a few months after -- this is your second 
19 request to Google, in May 2012 -- 
20      A   Correct.
21      Q   -- where you were trying to --
22      A   Yes.
23      Q   And if you'll look -- so we see that same kind 
24 of list of form entries and kind of categories.  Under 
25 legalother_explain, what does that say there?

1      A   Legalother_explain -- oh.  "Contains defamatory 
2 content at that is illegal in California. 
3 Legalother_quote:  contains photo and content."  It says, 
4 "This guy is insane pure and simple and this guy did a 
5 bunch of drugs."
6          And then I wrote "Cyberbully has started a Gmail 
7 account in my name as well."  And I guess this is the 
8 list of the Gmail account, 
 -- or no, it 
9 isn't, sorry.  I wrote that, I see.  It looks like more 
10 code down below.  Sorry, my mistake, yeah.
11      Q   Right.  Down below, it looks like it's a code to 
12 the http -- 
13      A   Yeah.
14      Q   -- the www.jerk.com
15      A   Yes.
16      Q   So was that a link to your profile that was on 
17 Jerk.com?
18      A   Yes, it appears to be a link to my profile at 
19 Jerk.com.
20      Q   Okay.  And so, you know, when -- do you remember 
21 writing kind of the complaint there?
22      A   I do, yes.
23      Q   Okay.  And do you remember what you meant when 
24 you wrote, "Cyberbully has started a gmail account in my 
25 name as well"?

 -- 

CX0450-043

CX0450-044

45

1      A   Yes, because I had noticed that -- actually, 
2 what I believe had happened was initially when I looked 
3 at the site, it didn't have this gmail account on -- 
4 listed under my information.  It had only my name, 
5 residence and my age.
6      Q   Okay.
7      A   Later someone had gone through and added more 
8 negative comments about me and added this e-mail address.
9      Q   Okay.
10      A   And so between -- apparently between March 7th, 
11 2012 and May 13th of 2012, someone had added -- I noticed 
12 on the site someone had added an e-mail address and I 
13 became concerned about that.  And so I wrote in that not 
14 only have they made these comments on Jerk.com, but they 
15 started an e-mail address in my name, so -- and what 
16 happened with that was I tried e-mailing the address to 
17 see what would happen, and I don't -- I think it didn't 
18 go through.  And then I went into gmail and I got into 
19 Start Account and I started the account in that name to 
20 see if it had been used.
21      Q   Right.
22      A   Because I was concerned that these people had 
23 started an e-mail in my name and were using it and maybe 
24 they were using it for other purposes.  So -- but I was 
25 able to start that e-mail account in my name, so it was 

PUBLIC

46

1 not a real e-mail until I started it during my 
2 investigation.  I intentionally started it to see if it 
3 was an e-mail that had been used by someone else, but it 
4 hadn't been used.
5      Q   So when you first saw it, the e-mail wasn't 
6 there, but you think someone else added the comment --
7      A   Yes.
8      Q    -- and added the e-mail address?
9      A   Yes.  There were more -- over time there were 
10 more comments added to the site.  More defamatory 
11 comments after my friend's mother had written the 
12 positive comments about me, they rebutted to those 
13 comments and wrote more negative comments about me, and 
14 also posted this e-mail address.  And I saw the negative 
15 comments, and then I also saw the e-mail address, and I 
16 became concerned if they were maybe using like, you know 
17 identity, theft and started an e-mail in my name perhaps.
18 So that's why I tried to get that e-mail address, and I 
19 was able to do that.
20      Q   And the amount of time you spent in creating 
21 that gmail, that's also included --
22      A   Again, that's more time, yeah.
23      Q   And this CX 449, that's also a document that you 
24 brought in today?
25      A   Yes, it is, uh-huh.

CX0450-045

CX0450-046

47

48

1      Q   Okay.  Did you try to get the Jerk.com profile 
2 of you removed in -- did you try another way?
3      A   Yeah, I believe -- then the, you know, last 
4 thing I tried was -- or I'm not sure what sequence it 
5 was, but at two, possibly three, instances I tried to get 
6 removed by joining the site and paying money.
7      Q   Okay.  Can you tell me a little -- so you paid 
8 money to join the --
9      A   Yes.
10      Q    -- website?
11      A   I resisted doing that because I felt they were 
12 real unethical and that I didn't want to encourage what 
13 they were doing, I felt it was unethical.  So for quite 
14 some time I did not join the site and I tried these other 
15 methods, and none of 'em worked.  And at some point I 
16 just felt like even though it was unethical to support 
17 them, it was more damaging to me to have that information 
18 on the Internet.
19          And I do believe also at that time I noticed a 
20 drop in my business.  And I can't say whether it had 
21 anything to do with the Jerk.com website or not, but I 
22 perceived that it was a possibility.  So I decided, you 
23 know, I just gotta go ahead and give them the $30.  As 
24 unethical as they are, I'm going to do it and keep my 
25 business and they can have my $30, you know.

1          And so I tried that, and it didn't work.  I 
2 remember, you know, entering my credit card on the site 
3 and, you know, pressing enter and it -- if I remember 
4 correctly, the screen like did a little shift like it had 
5 accepted my credit card number, but then it just flipped 
6 to like the same thing it was before basically, and -- 
7 and I had no access anywhere to being a member or editing 
8 anything.  But yet the site had given me the impression 
9 that as soon as I had clicked "Pay," I was going to get 
10 some sort of access to membership and I would have some 
11 sort of way of editing my profile.  And I was not -- I 
12 didn't get any access like that.
13      Q   So when you paid the $30, you thought that once 
14 you put in the credit card number and you clicked Okay, 
15 or entered, you'd be able to edit --
16      A   Yeah, I believed that that would -- I was pretty 
17 certain that I had a really great chance of being able to 
18 edit my profile because I had read on the Google forum 
19 that a lot of people were able to do that.
20      Q   Okay.  And you said you didn't get anything once 
21 you put in --
22      A   No, nothing.
23      Q   Do you remember kind of -- did you think that, 
24 you know, if you hadn't signed up, you wouldn't have been 
25 able to kind of remove your profile, or alter it?

CX0450-047

CX0450-048

49

1      A   Can you repeat that question?
2      Q   Sure.  So you decide -- you know, you didn't 
3 want to sign up, but you said you finally decided to sign 
4 up because you thought it may have been affecting your 
5 business and that --
6      A   Yes.
7      Q   And did you think that if you hadn't signed up, 
8 do you think you could have -- I guess what I'm trying to 
9 ask is, without signing up, did you think you could 
10 remove the profile or ask for it to be edited or have 
11 access to the Jerk.com profile of you?
12      A   Without signing up?
13      Q   Right, did you think it was your only way to --
14      A   I felt it was absolutely my only way.  I had 
15 tried everything else on the site to try and change the 
16 negative information about me and there was no way to do 
17 it, you know.  And so I felt like that was really my 
18 only -- my only avenue to change, alter the negative 
19 comments that were made about me.
20      Q   When you signed up, did you think there was 
21 anything else that you would be getting in return, or 
22 that you would be able to do on the website once you 
23 signed up?  Or maybe you could restate again kind of what 
24 you thought you could do once you paid.
25      A   I think I thought that I would be able to edit 

PUBLIC

50

1 my profile and that I would be, you know, considered a 
2 member of the site, and there may have been other things 
3 indicated that would be available for membership, but I 
4 can't recall what they are.
5      Q   Do you remember kind of reading anything on the 
6 Jerk.com website about what you would get if you signed 
7 up for the $30 membership?
8      A   That's a good question.
9      Q   Feel free to take --
10      A   Yeah.  What would I get?  I believe there was 
11 some vague indication that I would have access to my 
12 information and editing it, but I don't even know exactly 
13 what that was.  That's all I can remember, uh-huh.
14      Q   Would it help if I showed you some screenshots 
15 of the website --
16      A   Yeah.
17      Q    -- if you remember reading those?
18      A   Sure.
19      Q   Okay.  Mr. 
 I'm going to show you what 
20 we've previously marked as CX272-001.  Take a minute to 
21 look at it.
22          This is a screenshot of a part of the Jerk -- do 
23 you remember -- does this look familiar to you?  Or does 
24 this look like, you know, what you saw on Jerk.com?
25      A   You know, I'm not sure that this is what I saw.

CX0450-049

CX0450-050

51

52

1 Something similar, but I'm not sure this is exactly what 
2 I saw.
3      Q   Does this look like, you know, what the Jerk.com 
4 website looked like when you --
5      A   Yeah, it does.
6      Q   Okay.
7      A   It definitely does.  I remember the heading Post 
8 a Jerk, Remove, School, Cities, I remember that, and the 
9 language sounds like it too, you know, Looking for the 
10 latest scoop on a world filled with jerks.  It definitely 
11 looks like the Jerk.com site to me, yes.
12          Whether or not this is the exact page that I saw 
13 when I signed up, I'm not sure.  But it was definitely 
14 very similar to this, yes.  I do remember that.
15      Q   Okay.  And I think -- I do you remember visiting 
16 any of the -- on the top there are different links, as 
17 you said, to Post a Jerk or Remove --
18      A   Yeah, as I stated earlier, I visited all -- I 
19 thoroughly examined the website looked at all of them, 
20 uh-huh.
21      Q   So would you have sort of clicked on --
22      A   Clicked on all the links, absolutely, uh-huh.
23      Q   Are there any other kinds of phrases or things 
24 on this page that you remember reading?
25      A   Well, you know, I remember this at the bottom, 

1 Having problems with signing in?  Get help.  Because I 
2 remember after I paid them I couldn't sign in and I 
3 remember clicking on that.
4      Q   Okay.
5      A   In the bottom right corner, I remember that.  I 
6 do remember that.
7      Q   So after you paid, did you ever receive a 
8 password?
9      A   No.
10      Q   And did you receive any type of user name or any 
11 other information -- 
12      A   No.
13      Q    -- for accessing --
14      A   No.  I never received anything from them, no.
15      Q   And do you remember if were you able to click on 
16 more parts of the website or get to places in the website 
17 that you weren't able to access before you paid?
18      A   No, I couldn't get to anything different and I 
19 just -- I remember trying everything, you know.
20      Q   So you said you remember trying the -- having 
21 problems with signing in.  Do you remember reading 
22 anything else on that page, or are there other phrases on 
23 that page that's familiar?
24      A   You know, I don't remember, but I definitely do 
25 remember this and clicking on it.  I don't know what 

CX0450-051

CX0450-052

53

1 happened when I clicked on it, I'm not certain, but -- 
2 yeah.
3      Q   After you paid, did you -- do you know whether, 
4 you know -- did you verify that you had been charged the 
5 $30?
6      A   Yeah, I did, uh-huh.  Yeah, I looked and I could 
7 see that it came out of my bank account on that card, 
8 uh-huh.
9      Q   And do you remember how many times you were 
10 charged?  Or whether you were just charged once?
11      A   I believe I was charged twice.  That I tri- -- I 
12 attempted to sign up two times and I believe I was 
13 charged for those two, and I don't recall for certain but 
14 I believe I may have gone back later and tried a third 
15 time.
16      Q   Okay.
17      A   But I'm not sure, uh-huh.
18      Q   And after each of those times, you didn't get 
19 any password?
20      A   Yeah, never did I receive a password or any 
21 other information.
22      Q   And we're still looking at CX 272.  Do you 
23 remember reading any of the other statements on this?
24      A   Not really.  Let's see.  I can't -- I don't 
25 know, the word sainthood does sounds familiar.  I may 

PUBLIC

54

1 have read that statement.  It says, "Sign now and grow to 
2 Sainthood while avoiding millions of jerks along the 
3 way," and I remember thinking that was real kind of 
4 ironic, you know, because I felt like they were really 
5 lacking a lot of integrity and yet they were using the 
6 word sainthood to join, and I felt like it was really 
7 ironic.
8      Q   Now I am going to show you what has previously 
9 been marked CX 275-001.  Does this screenshot of the 
10 Jerk.com website, does that look familiar to you?
11      A   Yeah, I think so.  Let me look at it.
12      Q   Sure, take your time.
13      A   Yeah, I remember this sentence, "Just because 
14 you have a profile on Jerk does not mean you are a Jerk."
15 That seems very familiar.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then they 
16 say, "or is a Saint in the eyes of others."  Yeah, I 
17 think I remember this for sure, uh-huh.
18      Q   Yeah.  So you think you read -- you remember 
19 reading "Jerk is where you" -- "Just because you have a 
20 profile on Jerk does not mean you are a Jerk"?
21      A   Uh-huh.
22      Q   And "Jerk is where you find out if someone is a 
23 Jerk, is not a Jerk or is a Saint in the eyes of others"?
24      A   Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that, uh-huh.
25 Yes.

CX0450-053

CX0450-054

55

56

1      Q   And do you remember reading anything else on 
2 the -- and this is the "Remove" -- the header here under 
3 Jerk is "Remove"?
4      A   Yes.  "Premium support is available for people 
5 who require a higher level of service than is provided 
6 for free."  Uh-huh.  
7      Q   Do you remember reading that sentence?
8      A   I remember reading something very similar, if 
9 not that sentence, yes, uh-huh.
10      Q   Okay.  And the final sentence on the page, "If 
11 you however use Jerk to manage your reputation and 
12 resolve disputes with people who are in conflict with.  
13 There are also additional paid premium features that are 
14 available," and gives the Jerk.com sign-in.  Do you 
15 remember reading that?
16      A   Yeah I do, yes.
17      Q   And do you remember -- what did you think you 
18 would get, you know, as part of the premium support?
19      A   I thought that I might be able to go in and 
20 remove the negative comments about me on the site.
21      Q   And do you remember if you tried to click on 
22 that Jerk.com contact link?
23      A   Yes, I did.
24      Q   And do you remember what you saw or --
25      A   Yeah, nothing -- nothing happened.  Or wait.

1      Q   There's two links there.  One's the Jerk.com 
2 contact and one's the Jerk.com sign-in.
3      A   Oh, okay.
4      Q   Do you remember clicking on either of those?
5      A   Yeah, I think when I clicked on these, that's 
6 when I was able to add my credit card information and 
7 sign up.
8      Q   Okay.  But you didn't actually -- did you reach 
9 anyone?  You didn't actually reach anyone?
10      A   No.  I guess I -- you know, I don't remember 
11 exactly everything, but I believe that I clicked on these 
12 links and, you know, nothing -- I wasn't able -- was able 
13 to maybe -- this is where I could enter my credit card 
14 information and sign up, but then after I did that, 
15 nothing happened that was different.
16      Q   Kind of on the top of that, near the top right 
17 of that same page, on CX 275, there's a little kind of 
18 tweet pledge that says, "Get our news, Everywhere!" and 
19 it says, Tweetfollow@Jerk_com_news."
20          Do you remember seeing the tweet message there?
21      A   No.
22      Q   Do you remember if you saw any Twitter message 
23 from them or visited a Twitter page?
24      A   I can't remember.
25      Q   Okay.  Do you remember, did you visit the Remove

1 page before you signed up?  It sounds like --
2      A   Yes.
3      Q    -- before you signed up and you paid the $30?
4      A   Yes.
5      Q   And then now I am going to show you what's been 
6 previously marked as CX 276-001.
7      A   Yeah.
8      Q   This is another screenshot of the Jerk.com 
9 website.  Does this screenshot look like the website when 
10 you saw it?
11      A   I think so, yeah.
12      Q   This is a Jerk screenshot and it says on the 
13 top, "Become A Subscriber" and it says, "Billing 
14 Information, You must be a subscriber member in order to 
15 create a dispute!"  And then it says, "if your billing 
16 information does not match billing address for credit 
17 card, there will be delays in order processing," and then 
18 it has various fields where you can put in your name and 
19 contact information and credit card.
20          Does this look like the form that you had --
21      A   Yes.
22      Q    -- submitted to put in your credit card?
23      A   Yes.
24      Q   And do you remember reading any of the 
25 statements on this page?

PUBLIC

58

1      A   The Gold Membership sounds vaguely familiar.
2 But I'm not sure if I remember for certain, but it does 
3 sound familiar.
4      Q   What did you sign up for?  You know, there's a 
5 button for Gold Membership under -- and then there's a 
6 button for Standard Membership.  Which one did you sign 
7 up for?
8      A   I think initially the standard membership.
9      Q   But you said before you tried to --
10      A   Yeah, I really don't know, you know.
11      Q   Okay.
12      A   But I believe it was the standard for $30 a 
13 year.
14      Q   Is that because $30 is what you remember paying 
15 or being charged on --
16      A   Yes, that sounds like a familiar number, uh-huh, 
17 yes.
18      Q   So you submitted this form in order to become a 
19 member, and you said nothing happened once you put in 
20 your credit card information?
21      A   Uh-huh.
22      Q   Is there anything else you remember about the 
23 sign-up process for the membership?
24      A   I just remember hitting like Submit or whatever 
25 it was -- this main -- you know, honestly, this may not 

CX0450-057

CX0450-058

1 be the exact thing I saw.  I'm noticing here -- you know, 
2 2013-02-05, so it's possible that, you know, it was a 
3 similar -- the website was changed between the time that 
4 I signed up.
5      Q   Okay.
6      A   However, this looks very similar to what I 
7 signed up on, if not the same.  And I remember 
8 clicking -- entering all my information correctly, 
9 doubling checking it, like I do, and clicking Submit and 
10 having the screen just shake like it had been accepted 
11 almost, and then hitting it again and having nothing 
12 happen.
13          And then where my recollection isn't really very 
14 clear, I feel like I may have at that same setting redid 
15 it again, and put all my information in again and hit 
16 Submit again a second time.  But I'm not positive.  And I 
17 would like to look at my bank statements and check 
18 exactly what happened about those two charges.  It may 
19 have been two charges the same day, or I may have gone 
20 back a couple days later.  But I'm almost positive I 
21 tried to sign up twice, if not three times.
22      Q   Okay.  So when you first visited Jerk, was it 
23 principally a black background website?
24      A   Uh-huh, yes.
25      Q   And did it have red buttons?

1      A   Yeah, there was a lot of red and green and blue, 
2 uh-huh.
3      Q   Okay.
4      A   And I think maybe -- maybe yellow too.
5      Q   Okay.
6      A   I can't remember.  But it was -- definitely 
7 these colors like on this -- these printouts.  There was 
8 red buttons, black background, same logo, just like this.
9      Q   The same Jerk logo -- 
10      A   Yeah, same format, exactly.
11      Q   Okay, same format with headers on the top -- 
12 near the top of the web page that you can click on?
13      A   Yeah, I remember the Schools and Cities, Remove, 
14 Post a Jerk, I remember those headings, yeah.
15      Q   Okay, great.  I'm going to pause here for 
16 another quick break.
17              (Recess.)
18 BY MS. FANG:
19      Q   We're back on the record.
20      A   Okay, great.
21      Q   Okay, thank you.
22          So earlier you said that you saw somewhere on 
23 Jerk.com where it said that people could not remove 
24 profiles, or the public -- it was based on public 
25 searching, right?

CX0450-059

CX0450-060

61

1      A   Yes.
2      Q   And -- but it sounds like when you had bought 
3 the $30 membership, based on your understanding, you 
4 thought that you could, you know, alter or at least kind 
5 of meaningfully edit the Jerk.com profile of you; is that 
6 correct?
7      A   Yes, that's correct.
8      Q   And would it be accurate to say that then buying 
9 the $30 Jerk membership got you absolutely nothing?
10      A   Yes, that's correct.
11      Q   And do you remember when you were on the Google 
12 forum, do you remember other people having the same issue 
13 where they paid for a membership on got nothing?
14      A   No.
15      Q   Okay.  And do you remember what the Google forum 
16 name was that you checked out?
17      A   No.
18      Q   Was it a few different forums all on Google, or 
19 was it one forum?
20      A   I believe it could have been a few, but I'm not 
21 sure.
22      Q   Okay.  And also earlier, you know, you had 
23 suspicions of who might have posted you on the website.
24 Did you ever find out who posted you?
25      A   No.

PUBLIC

62

1      Q   And would you have wanted to find out who had 
2 posted the --
3      A   Yes.
4      Q   And you also tried a bunch of different ways of 
5 contacting Jerk, including e-mailing John Fanning at the 
6 John Fanning e-mail address.  Did you find any other way 
7 of contacting Jerk besides, you know, the e-mail to -- 
8 the John Fanning e-mail address on the Jerk website?
9      A   I don't believe I did.
10      Q   Okay.  So were you able to find any other e-mail 
11 or physical addresses associated with Jerk?
12      A   I think there was some physical addresses listed 
13 in one of the Google forums, the same one -- thread that 
14 I got the John Fanning e-mail from, I believe somewhere 
15 in one of the Google threads they listed even his 
16 personal address I believe.
17      Q   Okay.
18      A   Like his home address.
19      Q   Okay.
20      A   Not -- I don't know if it was his correct 
21 address or not, but I do remember seeing some addresses, 
22 yeah.  But they were I believe down in Los Angeles, and 
23 so I had no way of like physically going there, and I 
24 felt like it was really not plausible to write them by 
25 hand and didn't feel like I'd get a response or anything, 

CX0450-061

CX0450-062

63

64

1 so I didn't do anything with those addresses I don't 
2 think, so -- yeah.
3      Q   Okay.  So you thought it would be more likely to 
4 get a response from e-mailing?
5      A   Yeah, it was pretty much all I felt was worth my 
6 effort, yeah.
7      Q   Before the break we were also looking at a few 
8 of the documents.  I wanted to show you -- well, I guess 
9 before we do that I actually want to go back.
10          You also said that you saw a lot of other 
11 profiles on the Jerk.com website?
12      A   Yes.
13      Q   Did you browse through the website to look at 
14 other profiles?
15      A   Yes.
16      Q   And what do you remember in those -- seeing on 
17 those profiles?
18      A   I remember seeing that some of 'em had photos of 
19 the person and some didn't.  Like myself, I didn't have a 
20 photo.  I remember seeing some of them had derogatory 
21 comments like myself, and some didn't.  Some were, you 
22 know, filled out extensively and had photos and lots of 
23 comments, and some had little to no information on them.
24      Q   And did they generally look like your profile in 
25 terms of the website, the layout --

1      A   Yes.
2      Q    -- and the types of information?
3      A   Yes.
4      Q   Did you visit the Jerk Of The -- are you --
5      A   Jerk Of The Day?
6      Q   Does that sound familiar?
7      A   Yeah, I saw Jerk Of The Day and I looked at it 
8 on more than one occasion, yes.
9      Q   And when you looked at it on the different 
10 occasions, were they different profiles that were posted 
11 each time you looked?
12      A   Yes.  And I believe there was a button or a 
13 section where you could pay extra money and have someone 
14 nominated for Jerk Of The Day, if I'm not mistaken.
15      Q   Okay, you remember seeing that?
16      A   Uh-huh.
17      Q   Do you remember any other sections of the 
18 website?
19      A   Yeah, there were a lot of sections.  I think 
20 there was -- like in this here.  Here, there was Post a 
21 Jerk, Remove A Jerk, that the statement that you couldn't 
22 be removed.  Then there was Schools, Cities.  I can't 
23 remember exactly what those were, but yeah, there were -- 
24 I remember there were a lot of different -- it's pretty 
25 extensive -- a fairly extensive website.

CX0450-063

CX0450-064

65

1      Q   And I know we looked earlier at CX272-001, and 
2 that is still in front of you there.  Do you remember 
3 reading this statement on that page, "Want to join 
4 millions of people who already use Jerk for important 
5 updates for business, dating and more?"  Does --
6      A   It sounds familiar.
7      Q   Okay.  And now I'd like to show you what has 
8 previously been marked CX0273.  Do you remember seeing a 
9 page on Jerk that looked identical, or similar to this 
10 document?
11      A   Yeah, I think there was something like this, 
12 uh-huh.  But I'm not sure.  Yeah, I'm not positive.
13      Q   You're not, okay.  Could you describe what's in 
14 that document?  What it looks like?
15      A   It's like the terms and conditions of 
16 membership.  Must be 14 years old, Online Conduct, agree 
17 that you're responsible for conduct, indemnity, you will 
18 defend, indemnify, hold harmless Jerk LLC, its officers, 
19 online content, opinions, prior statements, removal.
20          Yeah, just -- it looks like terms of use and 
21 legal limitation of liability state by state.  Like an 
22 attempt to sort of cover themselves legally in the use of 
23 the site.
24          I don't specifically remember these pages, but 
25 it's possible I did see 'em.

PUBLIC

66

1      Q   Earlier you mentioned that you read some rules 
2 on the -- you know, when you were looking through Jerk 
3 and you clicked on different -- you mentioned you clicked 
4 on different rules of the site.  Is this what you 
5 remember seeing?  Is that you went by the rules of the 
6 website?
7      A   No, I think I was referring to the -- or when I 
8 clicked on Remove, there was a section that said you 
9 couldn't be taken off Jerk.com.
10      Q   Okay.
11      A   It indicated you might be able to alter your -- 
12 you know, whether or not were you a jerk on Jerk.com by 
13 membership or by, you know, public opinion, but that once 
14 you were on Jerk.com, you needed to stay on Jerk.com.
15 You weren't -- they weren't going to take you off.  I 
16 remember that.
17          As far as the rules, I think that's what I was 
18 referring to.
19      Q   That's what -- okay.
20      A   Yeah.
21      Q   On that -- on CX-273, No. -- Item 4, it says -- 
22 you know, "Online Content, opinions, advice, statements 
23 offers or other information or content made available 
24 through Jerk.com are those of their respective authors 
25 and not of Jerk LLC, and should not necessarily be relied

68

1 upon.  Such authors are solely responsible for the 
2 accuracy of such content."
3          Does that statement sound familiar?
4      A   No, I mean this page could have definitely been 
5 there, but I don't remember that, no.
6      Q   Okay.  And then in Item No. 12, this is the 
7 Copyright Policy and Contact Information for DMCA 
8 Notices."  It says -- you know, the last sentence, "If 
9 you believe that your copyright has been infringed 
10 through use of Jerk.com, please contact our customer 
11 service."
12          Do you remember reading that statement, or does 
13 that sound familiar?
14      A   Yeah, I may have.  It sounds familiar.  I don't 
15 remember this statement exactly, but I may have read 
16 something like that, yeah.
17      Q   Okay.  Now I'm going to give you another 
18 document that's been previously marked CX 274-001.  Do 
19 you remember seeing this page on Jerk?
20      A   I believe so, uh-huh.
21      Q   And what is this page?
22      A   Post a Jerk.  And it has a section you can enter 
23 someone -- enter them on the site.
24      Q   Okay.  When you visited the site, did you think 
25 that you could add -- post someone to the website?

1      A   Yes.
2      Q   And did you try to post anyone?  Or post --
3      A   Yeah, honestly, I think I went -- I looked to 
4 see if the woman that I thought was responsible for the 
5 defamatory comments against me, I searched her name and I 
6 found her name on the site, and I was really tempted to 
7 post some defamatory content against her, but I felt like 
8 that would be really unwise and I refrained from doing 
9 it.
10      Q   So did you think, you know, this feature was how 
11 people got profiled on Jerk.com?
12      A   Yeah, I thought that this was one of the ways.
13 I thought that also you could end up on Jerk.com because 
14 they had accessed your information from Google, because I 
15 read that in my research. 
16      Q   Oh.
17      A   And I think I remember looking at people's -- 
18 just random people -- you know, Joe Smith or something 
19 and seeing, you know, that they had an actual picture.
20 Because a lot of the profiles didn't have pictures, and 
21 so I went to Facebook and I clicked on that person, and 
22 yes, indeed, that person would have a public profile with 
23 the same picture.  And so I could see that, yes, indeed, 
24 you know, Jerk.com was mining Facebook to get 
25 information, and I sort of verified what I had read 

CX0450-067

CX0450-068

69

1 myself by doing that.
2      Q   Okay.  So it sounds like one of the ways people 
3 could get on was through this Post a Jerk -- 
4      A   That's right.
5      Q   -- feature.  And so also read somewhere from the 
6 Google forum that --
7      A   Yeah.
8      Q    -- I didn't fully follow that -- people could 
9 also get on if they were -- you could search for them on 
10 Google?
11      A   Yes.  Somehow -- I believe that somehow Jerk.com 
12 had accessed Facebook's information, or at least the 
13 public accounts or something, and somehow were able to 
14 copy that information and put it into website form for 
15 themselves and use that information.
16          I didn't initially believe that.  When I first 
17 accessed the site and saw it, I didn't know that.  I just 
18 thought that maybe people had filled out this form and 
19 posted me on there, and it was like, Wow, it's really 
20 amazing.  And then later as I researched, I found out 
21 that maybe it was from Google.  And I have a Facebook 
22 account and it was private, so there was no photo 
23 showing, so I figured yeah, that must be where they got 
24 it.
25      Q   Okay.  So after later research, you learned 

PUBLIC

70

1 another possibility would be through --
2      A   Yeah, I figured either -- from my profile, 
3 somebody either figured this out or, you know, they got 
4 it from Facebook.
5      Q   Okay.  But when you first went to the website, 
6 you just thought someone put you on the website?
7      A   Yes, I did, uh-huh, yes.
8      Q   Now, this exhibit you have in front of you, 
9 CX-275 -- I think we actually talked about this earlier.
10 Is there anything else you remember reading on this page?
11      A   Yeah, I remember reading that you couldn't be 
12 removed.  "Jerk is where you find out if someone is a 
13 Jerk" -- oh.  Oh, yeah, it -- this is a little 
14 different -- somewhere I remember reading that -- they 
15 said that -- basically, in so many words, they said that 
16 they were doing a public service by having the site, and, 
17 you know, they would be unethical if they let somebody 
18 remove them or something, and just that you were going to 
19 have to be on the site permanently.
20          I don't see that language here, but I do 
21 remember reading that under -- I believe under the remove 
22 section, so --
23      Q   Okay. 
24      A   And I don't -- you know, actually -- you know, I 
25 don't think this is the rule that I saw, because this is 

CX0450-069

CX0450-070

71

72

1 dated 2013, and I don't remember this part about the 
2 people under 14, and I remember language saying that 
3 if -- that you couldn't be removed. 
4      Q   Okay.
5      A   You know, that they were doing -- like I said, 
6 it was kind of like that it was their ethical standpoint, 
7 that they just wanted to do the public a service by 
8 posting this site for people, almost like they were a 
9 societal watchdog or something.  So --
10      Q   Okay.  So you might have seen --
11      A   Different language.
12      Q   -- different --
13      A   Uh-huh.  I believe it was, uh-huh.
14      Q   Okay.
15      A   Very -- a lot of it was similar.  Like I said 
16 before, I think this word sainthood was familiar, so -- 
17 I'm just guessing perhaps this is a later page and it may 
18 have been edited from the ones I originally viewed a year 
19 prior.
20      Q   Okay.
21      A   It was very similar.
22          MS. FANG:  And we're going to go off the record 
23 again.
24              (Recess.)
25 BY MS. FANG:

1      Q   We're back on the record.
2      A   All right.
3      Q   So earlier, you know, we talked about different 
4 ways that you tried to contact the Jerk website.  Did you 
5 try looking for Jerk.com's contact information on the 
6 website?
7      A   Yes, I believe so.  Yes, absolutely, uh-huh.
8      Q   Were you able to find any contact information?
9      A   Well, yeah, I -- I don't think I was able to 
10 contact them.
11      Q   Do you remember if you found any e-mail address 
12 for Jerk on the website?
13      A   I can't remember.
14      Q   Do you remember if you found any physical 
15 address for Jerk on the website?
16      A   I can't remember.
17      Q   And do you remember finding or seeing any phone 
18 number for Jerk on the Jerk website?
19      A   I don't believe I found one because I would have 
20 called it.
21      Q   Okay.  And do you think you would have e-mailed 
22 Jerk --
23      A   Yes.
24      Q    -- if you had found an e-mail address?
25      A   Yes, and I didn't see any e-mails to them when I 

CX0450-071

CX0450-072

73

1 searched Jerk in my e-mail folders.  I don't erase any 
2 e-mails, so I mean, I'm assuming that no, I was not able 
3 to e-mail them at all, yeah.
4      Q   Okay.  And you said that -- did you -- you said 
5 you also looked on the Google forum where you were able 
6 to find that John Fanning e-mail.  Did you look anywhere 
7 else on the Internet or anywhere else for other contact 
8 information?
9      A   Yes.
10      Q   And so you found -- on the Google forum you 
11 found the e-mail address and you found the physical 
12 address.  Were you able to find any e-mail address for 
13 Jerk, the company, either in the Google forum or anywhere 
14 else you searched?
15      A   I don't believe so.
16      Q   Okay.
17      A   Otherwise I would have written them an e-mail.
18      Q   And did you find a phone number for Jerk 
19 anywhere else?
20      A   No.
21      Q   And did you find any physical address for Jerk?
22      A   No.
23      Q   Okay.  Now I'm going to show you what's been 
24 previously marked as CX038.
25      A   Yeah.

PUBLIC

74

1      Q   Do you remember submitting a sworn and signed 
2 declaration to the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, in 
3 October 2012?
4      A   Yes.
5      Q   And is this document that declaration you 
6 submitted?
7      A   Yes.
8      Q   Please take a few minutes to read the document.
9      A   Uh-huh.  Yes, this is true.
10      Q   You've finished reading?
11      A   Yes.
12      Q   Okay.  So in Paragraph 2 in the declaration, you 
13 said, "In February 2012 I was searching the Internet and 
14 typed my name into the Google search engine."
15      A   Uh-huh.
16      Q   Earlier today you were uncertain about the exact 
17 month when you found -- whether it was December 2011 or 
18 February 2012 or March 2012.
19      A   Yeah, right.
20      Q   Would you say that --
21      A   Well --
22      Q   -- it was one of -- during -- around that time?
23      A   Yes.
24      Q   That during one of those months you found it?
25      A   Yeah.  This may be the most accurate guess.  It 

CX0450-073

CX0450-074

75

76

1 was definitely between, you know, March, because I have 
2 this -- March 7th, I have this e-mail where I was writing 
3 to Google about them, and then I believe somewhere 
4 around, you know, December, January or something, I had 
5 that other issue with that person, so I -- I mean, yeah, 
6 to me this is the most accurate time frame that I think 
7 it would have been, you know.
8          Yeah, it's probably somewhere in February.
9 January, February, uh-huh.
10      Q   Okay.  And it was definitely before March -- it 
11 was before March 2012 that you found -- 
12      A   Yeah, it was, uh-huh.
13      Q   Okay.  And then in paragraph 5, I think it's on 
14 the second page, on CX 0038-002, you said, "As of today 
15 my profile is still visible on Jerk.com and I have not 
16 received a password to activate my Jerk.com membership."
17          I think earlier today you mentioned that at some 
18 point you could no longer -- your profile was no longer 
19 on Jerk.com.
20      A   Yes.
21      Q   And so is it -- does this paragraph just need to 
22 be updated that -- meaning that --
23      A   Yeah, because on 2012, I guess I could still see 
24 my profile, and now it's been taken down.  Sometime 
25 between, you know, October of 2012 and now it's been 

1 taken down.
2      Q   Okay.
3      A   I'm not sure.  I think that happened -- you 
4 know, I can't remember when that happened.
5      Q   Okay.  But -- right, in October of 2012 it was 
6 still up?
7      A   Uh-huh.
8      Q   And so now, two years later, it's down.
9      A   Uh-huh.
10      Q   Apart from these two differences in Paragraph 2 
11 and Paragraph 5, is the rest of the declaration true and 
12 accurate?
13      A   Yeah, I think I left out that -- the part, I 
14 said I checked my bank statement and confirmed that 
15 Jerk.com withdrew 30 from my account, and I think that 
16 there's a really good possibility I left out that there 
17 was more than one charge -- 
18      Q   Okay.
19      A   -- so I need to research that.
20      Q   Okay.  But it's accurate -- you at least checked 
21 it once -- 
22      A   Yeah, I --
23      Q   -- and you know --
24      A   Yeah, I know for sure I saw it on my account, 
25 yes.  Because I remember being just really upset that not 

CX0450-075

CX0450-076

77

1 only had I been told that I was going get something, but 
2 I got -- and having this terrible information on there, 
3 but that I got absolutely nothing, you know, and that was 
4 just -- yeah, I know I got charged, and I was like I have 
5 to see, did they charge me for that -- 
6      Q   Right.
7      A   -- and then I looked and they did, indeed, yes.
8      Q   And then -- but apart from possibly be charged 
9 twice, is the remainder of the declaration true and 
10 accurate?
11      A   Yes.
12      Q   Great.  I have no more questions for now.  Thank 
13 you very much for your time today, Mr. 
14          As you saw, all we've said here today has been 
15 typed, and so the court reporter will send all of us a 
16 copy of your testimony and you have the opportunity to 
17 read and review and sign the deposition transcript within 
18 30 days.
19      A   Okay.
20      Q   And so if for -- you know, you can also waive 
21 the opportunity to sign it and review right now.  There's 
22 no charge for you to actually -- you know, get the 
23 transcript.  It will be sent to you and you can review 
24 and sign it.
25      A   Oh, okay.

PUBLIC

78

1          MR. YANKILOVICH:  So just to add to what Yan has 
2 said, our understanding is that they will send the 
3 transcript to your physical address.  However, if you 
4 want to provide an e-mail address, and we can do that off 
5 the record, a copy will be e-mailed to you within I think 
6 four business days, which is our customary turnaround.
7          THE WITNESS:  Sure.
8          MR. YANKILOVICH:  And like Yan said, there's no 
9 cost, and I believe, but I'm not exactly sure sitting 
10 here, that there's a 30 day period where if you find any 
11 errors, you can submit a correction sheet.  And then in 
12 the end you either have to return a signature page 
13 stating, yes, this all looks good and correct, or you've 
14 gotta affirmatively refuse to sign, so that -- because we 
15 have to tell the Court whether the person signed or 
16 somehow didn't want to sign.
17          And as Yan mentioned last week, you know, if you 
18 have absolutely no desire to review the transcript, 
19 you're welcome to waive the review and signature.  But 
20 it's completely your choice.  You're more than welcome to 
21 review it and make sure all of your testimony has been 
22 correct.
23          So that -- just for your information, I wanted 
24 to kind of clarify the process, because this is sort of 
25 technical minutia that is not common sense stuff.

CX0450-077

CX0450-078

79

80

1      A   Yeah.  I understand.  I have one question and 
2 that is, I still have the possibility of locating, you 
3 know, my bank statements with the charges from Jerk.com 
4 and possibly some screenshots.  So would it be wise to 
5 try and look for those in the next week or something and 
6 then provide those to you if I find them, and should I 
7 wait before I sign my statement to do that or -- 
8          MR. YANKILOVICH:  Well, let's -- that we can 
9 talk about off the record, because that doesn't directly 
10 bear on the content of the deposition.  But it's your -- 
11          THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
12          MR. YANKILOVICH:  I don't -- I can't foresee how 
13 finding additional documents would have any bearing.  Of 
14 course, if you find documents that for some reason 
15 contradict or reveal errors in some of your testimony, it 
16 may be wise to, you know, say you'll wait and submit 
17 corrections.  So it sounds like maybe the smarter course 
18 is to review the transcript.
19          But we can talk about the documents and the 
20 protocol off the records.
21          THE WITNESS:  Okay, yeah.
22          MS. FANG:  Thank you very much for your time.  I 
23 think that those are all my questions.
24      (Whereupon, at 1:27 p.m., the hearing was 
25 concluded.)

Dear Maria:

Thank you for your e-mail below. I’ve been unsuccessful reaching you by telephone, but I understand
you must be inundated.  I am following up in writing because this is an extremely important and time-
sensitive issue for our client, 

.

While we recognize and appreciate that the Communications Decency Act (specifically, 47 U.S.C. §230,
the “Act”) protects your client from the status of “publisher” or “speaker” of offensive Internet posts on
its site, we also point out that the very aim of the Good Samaritan clauses of the Act is to facilitate (and
shield from liability for) the good faith removal of user-generated content that may be considered
obscene, lewd,  filthy, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is
constitutionally protected.  Under the Act, your client also would not be civilly liable for taking action to
enable or make available to

information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access the objectionable material.

Importantly, it appears your client’s own Terms & Conditions contemplate the Act.  Specifically,
Paragraph 2 states: [Account holder] will NOT post on jerk.com any defamatory, inaccurate, abusive,
obscene, profane, offensive, threatening, harassing … material …”  The Terms & Conditions also call for
termination of the account holder’s account.

This letter is not intended as a threat to Jerk, by legal action or otherwise.  We are merely requesting
that your client adhere to its own Terms & Conditions and act in a manner consistent with the spirit of
the Act under which it claims immunity.  We repeat our request that the offending account be
terminated, and the account holder information released to 
offending posts be made invisible.

 We further request that the

 REMOVAL - TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATION

Thank you for getting back at me regarding this request. I already checked your site and find ways to
request for removal of post, however there is a charge that I should pay. I would like to know if there
are other ways to remove my husband's profile other than paying?

I hope to hear from you soon.

Maria -

Thanks for getting back to me.

In the interest of full disclosure, what we have is two parties on opposite sides of a dispute, about
postings made on Jerk.com.  Our client was the subject of the offending posts, the other side was the
party posting.  The parties are in the process of resolving the issues, but the final piece is the
requirement that the other side remove the offending posts.  The other side, through its counsel, has
agreed to remove the posts, but needs to know from Jerk exactly what steps it can (and must) take to
remove them.  My understanding is that they've been unsuccessful in getting through to Jerk Support,
to get its assistance with take-down (or other remedy).

As I mentioned to you before, I am not the poster - I created an account with Jerk in the effort to
dispute or report the posts, but had no luck.  I've also e-mailed Jerk Support (they were previously
responsive), but... crickets.
use credit cards for such things.  Further - if I or the other side enter credit card or other payment
information, we want some assurance that we would be afforded the benefit of Jerk Support's help in
removing the posts.

 Surely, it is not the $25 that is the issue - it is simply our firm policy not to

We just want to speak to Jerk Support to determine what steps the parties can take to remove the
offending posts, and then have a discussion with counsel for the other side on the line to discuss each
needed step.  If we have to pay $25 to speak with Jerk Support about this - or $90 for a year
subscription to deal with this - so be it.

Lawyer-to-lawyer, we are asking that you please facilitate the communication with Jerk Support and let
us know what costs are involved.

I do not I understand.  What happens when you try to reach support?  When you say that you are
uncomfortable with entering a credit card and making a payment, do you mean that you haven't done
that?  My understanding is that support is $25.  So, are you saying that you are willing to charge your
client for the time you have taken in these communications and comfortable with me billing my client
for my time in this, but not comfortable with paying $25?

Per my voice mail of a few moments ago:

Following our discussion last Friday, we've tried repeatedly - without success - to reach Jerk Support, to
ask how a subscriber to its site might go about removing or at least hiding certain posts. We are
contacting you again because Jerk Support has been unresponsive (and contacting Jerk Support through
the Jerk site requires entry of a credit card number and payment, something we are obviously not
comfortable with).

We ask that you please forward this on to Jerk and ask that they get in touch with me directly, or
please provide me with contact information I can use to reach someone in a position that can assist.

We note that we are working closely with the offending poster, to resolve these issues.  They are
cooperating but we need Jerk's help to complete the final pieces.

Thank you,

Where, How and Who can I contact to address this issue?  This is extremely important and I have tried
every address, etc online to let them know this is serious matter and every letter has been returned
unopened.  I need a way to contact Jerk.com to get this resolved as quickly as possible. I should not
have to "pay" them to have my private pictures removed.  It should just be done if someone is in need.

As I mentioned before I've already had to cancel my facebook page where they got the original picture
from in the first place because of my safety issues.

I would deeply appreciate any help with this matter.

 I have written letters, emailed and even tried phone numbers to no avail.

 My picture from facebook was taken by Jerk.com about a year and half ago.  Now they have

somehow taken private, personal family photos and posted them on my name.

 My safety is in jeopardy. I have also contacted Google regarding privacy/security.

Thank you for assistance thus far, with respect to the removal of certain posts from Jerk.com, where
those posts pertained to our client,

There are additional posts - made by the same account-holder as the previously removed posts - that
are of concern to our client, and to the account-holder, who has agreed to take the necessary steps to
remove, retract, or make invisible the subject posts.  To date, the account-holder has been
unsuccessful, despite its apparent efforts.

We'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you the steps that the account-holder can take to
remedy the situation.  We would like to include counsel for the account-holder in the dialogue, at some

Re:  

Dear Ms. McLeod-Lofquist:

I am in receipt of your letter of November 27, 2012. The content on Jerk.com was posted by a third
party user.  Your letter threatens legal action against the operators of the website despite the immunity
provided by the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. §230.  Claims based upon Minnesota law and
privacy rights may be applicable to the user who posted the content, but are completely inapplicable to
the operator of the website.

Your letter also seeks disclosure of the user who posted the content.  The First Amendment provides a
right to anonymous free speech.  Pursuant to case law, for example the Mobilisa case in Arizona, the
operator of a website need not turn over author information without compliance with the process set
forth in Mobilisa.

It may be helpful for you to know that Jerk.com does have a paid online support feature through which
your client can request removal.

Can you please clarify what do you mean by $ 25 for service? I don't want any service from the
website, I want the profile to be gone. If I opt in and pay the money how will you help me removing it?
Will it then not be the case that I cannot close the profile for ever? Please let me know what the
process is/

 Here is all I know.  The website assures me that if you pay $25 for service they are almost always
able to help you handle your particular issue. I have not received any complaints from people who have
paid for service. There is also a link forwarding feature that costs a little more.  If you try the support
service and it does not work, let me know and I will take the issue up with my client.

 Hi Maria,

 I understand you're very busy and I am sorry to be bothering you again but I really need your

help with this issue. I am pretty sure you understand me. This is a very frustrating issue and I want to
resolve it as soon as possible. I never created any profiles and I don't accept the fact that my personal
details have been used in such a manner against me. I don't own any social pages myself and I don't
know how my personal picture ended up online. I really need your help. I have no one else to turn to
about this issue. Please do help me with issue.

 Thanks

 Excellent! Can you please guide me step by step because I cannot see anything coming up that

would suggest a removal of a profile. I understand that you have dealt with similar cases before so
please let me know how can I remove it completely. I want to remove my profile. Let the information
stay where it stays. Please, Maria, I am being entirely serious. You don't understand how much I want
this to go away.

 2012/12/13 Maria Crimi Speth <mcs@jaburgwilk.com>

 You are misconstruing the wording, which probably should be clearer.  The statement that it will
not be removed is a statement that it will not be removed from the Internet.  In other words, even if
you removed it from Jerk.com, the source of the information is still on the internet.  I was not trying to
be cute, it is my understanding that you can request removal through support despite the language that
seems to suggest otherwise.

Your e-mail to me yesterday stated "The profile has been removed."  Any reasonable inference that can
be drawn from this statement, made by counsel, would lead us - and our client - to believe that 
(the

 profile and posts located at http://www.jerk.com/

"Profile") was removed.  Based on our prior exchanges, it is also reasonable to infer that the removal
was permanent.  As mentioned yesterday,  the site and the Profile were indeed down for a time (see
attached screen images), went back up, and then appeared to be down again.  However, I learned late
in the afternoon that while the site and Profile were not visible or accessible to me, they were very
much live and active for others.

Today, the site and Profile remain up.

What your client apparently views as a game, our client takes very seriously.  This is our client's
company and reputation.  Meanwhile, we see no legitimate benefit to your client in leaving the Profile
up. It already received payment from our client seeking support and removal of the Profile, for which
our client obviously received no return on its investment.

Understanding that you may not have control over your client, and they may not be forthcoming with
you, we will give you and Jerk the courtesy of until close of business (5pm) our local time (Eastern
Standard Time) today, January 11, 2013, to communicate and get the  Profile permanently removed.  If

postings made on Jerk.com.  Our client was the subject of the offending posts, the other side was the
party posting.  The parties are in the process of resolving the issues, but the final piece is the
requirement that the other side remove the offending posts.  The other side, through its counsel, has
agreed to remove the posts, but needs to know from Jerk exactly what steps it can (and must) take to

Maria,

thank you for continuing the correspondence.

There is a one time fee of $90 plus a "maintenance" fee.

All I want is my information taken down. I don't know who would be so cruel to add it (perhaps an
angry ex boyfriend) but having my name connected to this site has caused serious professional
consequences.

I am not wealthy nor can afford to spend money to hire an attorney to fight the owners of the site.

I like everyone else who has been added to this site just want the bullying to stop and have our names
taken down.

What recourse do I have outside of pleading my case to you?

 Subject: Please Remove My Underage Son's Profile

 Hello,

 I would like to write to you about my son's profile on "Jerk.com." It has recently been called to my

attention, and as my son is being bullied in school it causes him great distress that one of his bullies
seemed to have created a page on your website. I am appalled to learn that your website promotes
bullying; especially when there is already a major issue with bullying in schools across America as I am
sure you are aware. My son is also under the age of 14, and I read that Jerk.com should remove a page
in this case. I am very worried about my son, and would very much appreciate if you remove his page
and ban his name from ever appearing on your website again. As a parent I am worried about my son
developing PTSD later on in life, or another severe psychiatric illness as a result of bullying. It's difficult
enough that he gets bullied in school, so he shouldn't have to deal with it at home as well. I am
especially worried due to the articles I read about which often state that bullying can lead to suicide;
even in very young victims despite the help they can get. Please have some sympathy and remove his
page, as well as ban his name from ever showing up on your website again. Thank you.

 Here is the link to the page:

 Sincerely,

JERK 00416

step to try and remove the disputed posts from Jerk.com.  This includes, but is not limited to, creating
accounts, entering credit card information (and paying for accounts/support), requesting removal, and
using the "support," "dispute," and "abuse" functions.  The best we were able to do was have our client
post a comment and get confirmation that it was received (see attached).  We've attempted to
communicate the issues to Jerk Support directly, and have been unsuccessful.  Indeed, we have not
received any communication from Support since the initial DMCA take-down on October 22, 2012.

>> In the interest of full disclosure, what we have is two parties on opposite sides of a dispute, about
postings made on Jerk.com.  Our client was the subject of the offending posts, the other side was the
party posting.  The parties are in the process of resolving the issues, but the final piece is the
requirement that the other side remove the offending posts.  The other side, through its counsel, has
agreed to remove the posts, but needs to know from Jerk exactly what steps it can (and must) take to
remove them.  My understanding is that they've been unsuccessful in getting through to Jerk Support,

to get its assistance with take-down (or other remedy).

information, we want some assurance that we would be afforded the benefit of Jerk Support's help in
removing the posts.
>>
>> We just want to speak to Jerk Support to determine what steps the parties can take to remove the
offending posts, and then have a discussion with counsel for the other side on the line to discuss each
needed step.  If we have to pay $25 to speak with Jerk Support about this - or $90 for a year
subscription to deal with this - so be it.

let us know what costs are involved.

uncomfortable with entering a credit card and making a payment, do you mean that you haven't done
that?  My understanding is that support is $25.  So, are you saying that you are willing to charge your
client for the time you have taken in these communications and comfortable with me billing my client
for my time in this, but not comfortable with paying $25?
