PUBLIC 

OPPOSITION OF RESPONDENT JOHN FANNING TO COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S 

MOTION FOR SUMMARY DECISION 

Respondent John Fanning ("Fanning"), pursuant to Section 3.24 of the Commission's 

Rules of Practice, opposes Complaint Counsel's Motion for Summary Decision.  Complaint 

Counsel js not entitled to relief, as a matter of law.  Complaint Counsel fails to establish all 

essential elements of a Section 5 claim, improperly seeks to extend the Com.nllssion's regulatory 

authority, unlawfully seeks to repress Fanning's free speech in violation of the First Amendment, 

improperly  pierces the corporate structure, and requests remedies that multiple courts have 

rejected as over-reaching and in violation ofthe Commission's mandate.  Fanning is entitled to 

the benefit of all inferences at this stage of the litigation.  Summary decision is not appropriate, 

and Fanning is entitled to trial on the merits of the claims before an Administrative Law Judge, a 

neutral arbiter who will weigh the evidence and determine cred.Jbility, and not merely adopt 

Complaint Counsel's version of the facts and law.  In further Opposition, Fanning relies upon the 

{K0565499.1} 

Affidavit of John Fanning and the Affidavit of Peter F  Carr, IZ  Esquire, as well as his 

Memorandum of Law filed contemporaneously herewith. 

For the foregoing reasons, Respondent John Fanning requests the Commission to deny 

Complaint Counsel's motion for summary decision, in its entirety. 

Respectfully submitted, 

JOHN FANNING,

MEMORANDUM OF RESPONDENT JOHN FANNING IN OPPOSITION TO 

COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY DECISION 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Respondent John Fanning ("Fanning'') cannot possibly be expected to respond to each 

and every statement, allegation, claim, or innuendo posited by Complaint Counsel in its Motion 

for Summary Decision, and the 183 separate statements of purported undisputed material facts 

strewn over 75 pages.1  Indeed, many of the claimed facts by Complaint Counsel are not 

material, are disputed, and submitted solely to cast Fanning in a negative light  Complaint 

Counsel has no desire to try the case on the merits, so instead characterizes evidence and takes 

statements out of context to distort the truth to convince the Commission that punishment of 

Fanning is necessary because he is a scoundreL  Indeed, Complaint Counsel's statement of so-

1 Because of the scope and breadth of the Statement of Material Facts, Fanning does not set forth specific responses 
to each numbered paragraph.  The task would be virtually impossible, especially where many of the so-called facts 
are chara.cterizations of the evidence by Complaint Counsel, who consistently lwnps Fanning and Jerk, LLC 
together as "Respondents" throughout the pleadin,gs.  Complaint Counsel's flouting the rules requiring a short and 
plain statement of only those undisputed material facts excuses Fanning from any point by point response. 

{K0565342.1J 

called undisputed material facts is such a blatant violation ofthe procedural rules, and all notions 

of faimess, that the motion should be stricken so that the case can proceed to trial where the 

Administrative Law Judge will weigh credibility, draw inferences, and make ultimate findings of 

fact to which the controlling Jaw will apply.  Summary disposition of the claims -against Fanning 

is barred, no matter how many pages Complaint Counsel files.  Complaint Counsel intentionally 

over-reaches, ignores controlling law, and attempts to expand unilaterally the regulatory 

authority of the Commission because Complaint Counsel cannot establish all essential elements 

of a Section 5 deception claim necessary to impose liability on Fanning.  All claims asserted and 

remedies requested by Complaint Counsel must be tried on the merits consistent with Due 

Process and fairness instead of decided on summary disposition. 

rr  FACTUALS~Y 

Jerk..com was launched in approximately 2009 as an alternate social media and 

reputational website.  Fanning served as an advisor to Jerk, LLC through another company called 

NetCapital.com, LLC.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 2).  NetCapital.com. LLC is a private equity/venture 

capital firm that invests in and provides advisory services to technology start-ups.  (Fanning Aff., 

, 2).  Jerk, LLC, an internet technology start-up, was not a typical large company with levels of 

management and regular employees.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 3).  Fanning's authority was limited, and 

at all times Fanning acted on behalf ofNetCapitlal.com, LLC as a corporate entity, never in his 

individual capacity.  (Fanning Aft, ,  3).  Fanning did not write any software code for Jerk, LLC 

to operate Jerkcom, and did not place any consumer content on Jerk. com.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 3). 

Fanning, personally, was not responsible for spearheading and operating Jerk, LLC or Jerk.com. 

(Fanning Aff., ~ 3). 

.(K0565342.1} 

2 

Jerk, LLC did not even own a website.  Rather, Jerk, LLC operated the Jerk.com site 

through a lease with an option to purchase agreement entered into with a company called Internet 

Domains in February 201 1.  (CX0526-007).  In or about May 2013, Internet Domains tenninated 

the lease agreement and took control of the Jerk.com domain.  (CX0527-001-003).  Any 

information posted on Jerk. com prior to the commencement of the domain lease and after May 

2013 is highly suspect, given that Internet Domains owned the domain name.  Jerk, LLC 

terminated involvement with Jerk. com by the end of 2013, and profiles previously posted on 

Jerk.com no longer existed. 

Jerk, LLC established an agent, a lawyer in Phoenix, Arizona, to accept service of 

complaints about Jerk.com.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 4).  Each time that Jerk, LLC received a valid 

complaint, Jerk, LLC took action inclucling to remove content from the Jerk.com site and to 

refund money to consumers who claimed they had paid but had not received services.  (Fanning 

Aff., ~ 4).  Jerk, LLC experienced a number of problems in operating the site, inclucling the site 

being hacked.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 4).  The FTC also made written demand on Jerk, LLC to take 

corrective action.  Although the company denied any liability, Jerk, LLC consistently complied 

with the FTC's demands.  (fanning Aff., ~ 4). 

Facebook complained that Jerk, LLC was violating policies and procedures concerning 

use ofFacebook.  Jerk, LLC rejected the allegations, and neither Jerk. LLC nor Fanning violated 

any valid contract or agreement with Facebook with respect to Jerk.com.  (Fanning Aff., ,15). 

Any information posted on Jerk. com that Facebook charged was a violation derived from users 

or public sources.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 5).  In fact, the entire Facebook directory containing user 

information and photographs was readily available to the public through the internet, and any 

person could have accessed the directory and posted the information on Jerk. com.  (Fanning Aff., 

{1<0565342. J) 

3 

~ 5).  Fanning never hacked into Facebook., and never directed anyone affiliated with Jerk, LLC 

to hack into Facebook with respect to Jerk. com.  (Fanning Aff., ~ 5). 

On December 17,2009, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (''EPIC"), a 

Washington-based advocacy group, filed a complaint against Facebook related to its privacy 

policies and procedures.  (EPIC Complaint, attached to Carr Aff.~ at Tab A).  The FTC 

conducted an investigation into Facebook's privacy settings.  The FTC subsequently filed an 

enforcement Complaint against Facebook.  (FTC Complaint, attached to Carr Aff., at Tab B).  In 

summary, the FTC alleged that Facebook deceived consumers by representing that consumers 

could keep their infonnation on Facebook private~ and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared 

and made public.  The FTC claimed that Facebook's privacy settings, revised in November 2009 

without notice to its users, were unfair and deceptive toward users because the settings permitted 

personal information to be disclosed to the public and third-party application developers. 

Facebook treated the following categories of personal data as "publicly available infonnation" 

subject to public disclosure and access: user names, profile photos, lists of friends, pages users 

are fans of~ gender, geographic regions, and networks to which users belonged.  By default, 

Facebook regularly disclosed <tpublicly available information" to search engines, to internet users 

whether or not they used Facebook, and other third-parties.  Facebook eventually settled the case 

with the FTC pursuant to a consent order.  (Decision and Order, attached to Carr Aff., at Tab C). 

In 2012, Complaint Counsel commenced an investigation of Jerk, LLC related to 

Jerk.com, claiming violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act based on alleged deceptive conduct. 

Complaint Counsel served broad Civil Investigative Demands on Jerk, LLC and numerous third(cid:173)

parties.  the FTC was upset when Fanning refused to be interviewed as part of the investigation. 

(Fanning Aff., 1 6).  Dw:ingthe course of the investigation, Complaint Counsel obtained sworn 

(K0565342.l} 

4 

statements, drafted with the direct assistance of Complaint Counsel and other FTC agents, from 

various consumers who bad visited Jerk.com.  According to Complaint Counsel, profiles posted 

on Jerk.com grew to in excess of 85 million.  Yet, Complaint Counsel obtained sworn statements 

from a limited number of consumers.  The bulk of the complaints involved angry consumers who 

allegedly learned that information they had posted on Facebook, and believed was private, 

appeared on Jerk. com without their consent.  Not one of the sworn statements indicates that a 

consumer posted information on Jerkcom in reliance on any representations made by Jer~ LLC 

or Fanning. 

m.  LAW AND ARGUMENT 

.A. 

Complaint Counsel is Not Entitled to Summary Decision 

The Commission has recognized that the standard of review for summary decision is 

"virtually identical to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56."  In re Me Wane, Inc., 2012 WL 

4101793, at *5 (2012), citing In re Polygram Holding,  136 F.T.C. 310, 2002 WL 31433923, at* 

1 (2002).  Summary judgment under Rule 56 is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no 

genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of 

law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  In order to prevail, a party moving for summary judgment must 

show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to an essential element of the 

nonmoving partis claim, or to a defense on which the non-moving party will bear the burden of 

persuasion at trial.  Celotex Corp. v. Catre!!, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  "(T]he inquiry involved 

in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment ... implicates the substantive evidentiary standard 

of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits."  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 4 77 U.S. 

242,252 (1986).  On summary judgment, the court draws all reasonable factual inferences in 

favor of the non-movant.  Andersog, 477 U.S. at 255. 

(K03653'12.1} 

5 

A court's role in ruling on motions for summary judgment is limited.  "[A]t the summary 

judgment stage the judge's function is not ... to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of 

the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial."  FTC v. Ross, 2012 WL 

2126533, at* 4 (D.Md. 2012), quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 (copy attached to Carr Aff., at 

Tab E).  "Even if the facts are undisputed, summary judgment may not be granted where there is 

disagreement over inferences that can be reasonably drawn from those facts.''  Ross, at *4, 

quoting In re Unisys Sav. Plan Litig., 74 F.3d 420, 433 (3rd Cir. 1996). 

Applying these well-established standards, Complaint Counsel fails to conclusively 

establish Section. 5 liability, and summary decision must be denied.  Complaint Counsel has the 

burden of proving each essential element of each alleged violation oflaw.  16 C.F.R. § 3 .43(a). 

As set forth below, Complaint Counsel fails to establish all essential elements of a Section 5 

claim for deception, as a matter of law.  Further, the relief sought by Complaint Counsel in its 

Proposed Order is unlawful applying well-settled legal principles governing FTC authority. 

B. 

Complaint Counsel Fails to State a Legal Claim For Deception 

Section 5 of the FTC Act expressly pro _vi des, "[t]he commission is empowered and 

directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations ... from using unfair methods of 

competition in commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce."  FTC v. Sperry 

&  Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 235 (1972), quoting 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(6).  The elements of a 

deceptive act or practice are:  (1) a representation that is (2) likely to mislead the consumer 

acting reasonably in the circumstances that is (3) material.  See FTC Policy Statement on 

Deception, appended to In re Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F. T.C. 1, 10, appendix at pp. 175-84 

(1984).  Complaint Counsel is unable to prove each essential element. 

{K0565342.. I I 

6 

J I, 
I' 

Sensing weakness in the claims asserted, Complaint Counsel either ignores or improperly 

attempts to expand the essential elements of deception liability under the FTC Act.  Complaint 

Counsel did not include any claim for ''unfairness" under Section 5, because of the more 

stringent standard that applies in unfairness cases, including the required showing of substantial 

injury to consumers.  There is no basis for substantial injury in this case.  Complaint Counsel 

should not be permitted to avoid the more stringent analysis by characterizing and pleading the 

claims under deception jurisdiction. 

1. 

There is no material misrepresentation about Jerk.com content 

With respect to the first prong, a representation conveys "a claim if consmners, acting 

reasonably under the circumstances, would interpret the a'dvertisement to contain that message . ., 

I 

POM Wonderful, LLC, 2013 LEXIS 6, at *20 (FTC Jan.  10, 2013).  The heart of a 

"representation" giving rise to Section 5 liability is a "claim" communicated to the consuming 

public.  See Cliffdale Assocs., 103 F.T.C. at 176.  See also POM Wonderful, at *20 (actionable 

representation is one that conveys a particular interpretation to a reasonable consumer); In re 

Novartis Com., 127 F.T.C 580, 689 (1999) (liability premised on respondent's knowledge that 

the deceptive claim was being communicated to the public); Kraft, Inc. v. FTC, 970 F.2d 311, 

322 (7th Cir. 1992) (describing three types of "claims .. within the FTC's statutory purview). 

Whether a statement is a "claim" constituting a ''representation .. is a question of fact.  See FTC 

v. QT, Inc., 448 F.Supp.2d 908, 957-958 (N.D.Ill. 2006), citing National Bakers Services, Inc. v. 

FTC, 329 F.2d 365, 367 (7th Cir.l964) (meaning of an advertisement, the claims or net 

impressions communicated to reasonable consumers, is fundamentally a question of fact); Kraft, 

970 F.2d at 317 ("[T]he determination of whether an ad has a tendency to deceive is an 

impressionistic one more closely akin to a finding of fact than a conclusion of law."). 

{K0565342.1}

Complaint Counsel cites as the lynchpin of Count I as follows: ''Respondents represented 

that content on Jerk, including names, photographs, and other content, was created by Jerk.com 

users and reflected those users' views of the profiled individuals."  (CCSMF, ~ 39).  Complaint 

Counsel, however, mis-states and falsely depicts the statements on the website.  The 

interpretations and characterizations postured by Complaint Counsel do not suffice. 

Complaint Counsel far exceeds the legal bounds of a "claim" properly regulated by the 

FTC by parsing and characterizing the language on the homepage, instead of pointing to specific, 

affirmative statements that were made to advertise or promote Jerk. com.  This fatal defect alone 

requires denial of the relief requested.  The Court in FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., 

569 F.Supp.2d 285} 298-299 (D.Mass. 2008) outlined the rubric that is supposed to govern, as 

follows: 

Generally, claims can be divided into two categories-establishment claims and 
non-establishment claims.  Establishment claims are those that contain 
"statements regarding the amount of support the advertiser has for the product 
claim.''  Policy Statement on Advertising Substantiation. They are in effect 
statements "that scientific tests establish that a product works." Removatron, 884 
F 2d at 1'492 n. 3. Common examples include statements such as "tests prove,'' 
"doctors recommend," or "studies show." Policy Statement on Advertising 
Substantiation; see also Thompson Med Co. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 191 F.2d 
189, 194 (D.C.Cir. 1986); Spalding Sports Worldwide. Inc. v. Wilson Sporting 
Goods Co., 198 F.Supp.2d 59, 67 (D.Mass. 2002); Gillette Co. v. Norelco 
Consumer Prods. Co., 946 F.Supp. 115, 121  (D.Mass. 1996) ('tAn establishment 
claim is one that says, in substance, that 'tests or studies prove' a certain fact."). 
In the case of establishment claims, the advertiser must be able to demonstrate 
that it has at least the advertised level of substantiation. 

In contrast, for non-establishment claims, what constitutes sufficient 
substantiation may depend on multiple factors, such as the type of claim, the 
product> the consequences of a false claim, the benefits of a truthful claim, the 
cost of developing substantiation for the claim, and the amount of substantiation 
experts in the field believe is reasonable. Removatron, 884 F.2d at 1492 n. 3; QI, 
448 F.Supp2d at 959 (citing Policy Statement Regarding Advertising 
Substantiation). For health-related efficacy and safety claims, the FTC has 
commonly insisted on ''competent and reliable scientific evidence." See, e.g., 
Removatron, 884 F.2d at 1498 (reviewing Commission Order that required claims 

(K0565342.1)

Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 741 F.2d 1146, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 1984) (same). 

Instead of meeting this rigorous standard, Complaint Counsel falsely cites the statements 

appearing on the homepage, and concocts out of whole-cloth the claimed representations.  The 

website does not include any affirmative statement about the origin of content  Complaint 

Counsel relies solely on and quotes to the statements previously featured on the Jerk. com 

homepage in the "About Us" and "Welcome to Jerk" tabs.  (CCSMF, ~~·  40-46).  A closer 

review, however, of the actual language shows that nothing is stated about content or views of 

users.  In reality and taken in context, the language cited by Complaint Counsel is part of a legal 

disclaimer intended to advise users of the restrictions on use and limitation of liability associated 

with use of the site.  (CX0273).  Nothing contained in the homepage disclaimer constitutes a 

"claim" about the source of content, either express or implied, or could possibly be construed as 

an advertisement intended to lure users to the Jerk.com site.  As a matter oflaw, Complaint 

Counsel has no legal basis to invoke deception jurisdiction based on the language cited.  See 

~ 970 F.2d at 322 (FTC authority is limited to (1) express claims; (2) implied claims where 

there is evidence that tbe seller intended to make the claim; and (3) claims that significantly 

involve health, safety, or other areas with which reasonable consumers would be concerned). 

Moreover, a "material" misrepresentation is one that involves information .important to 

consumers and that is therefore likely to affect the consumer's choice of, or conduct regarding, a 

product.  In re Novartis Corp., 127 F.T.C. at 689.  See also POM Wonderful at *121  ("A 

misleading claim or omission in advertising will violate Section 5  ... only if the omitted 

information would be a material factor in the consumer's decision to purchase the product."); 

Kraft. 970 F.2d at 322, quoting Cli.ffdale Assocs .•  103 F.T.C. at 165 (claim considered material jf 

{l<0565342.l) 

9 

it "involves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice 

of, or conduct regarding a product.").  The language in the legal disclaimer cribbed by Complaint 

Counsel was not presumptively material, and did not shape any reasonable consumer's choice 

with respect to Jerk. com. 

It is pure speculation to infer that any reasonable consumer would have read the 

homepage disclaimer advising on limitations of liability, prohibited practices, and other technical 

information as concerning the purpose, safety, efficacy, or cost of the product or service. 

Nonetheless, to the eA.1ent Complaint Counsel relies upon inferences, Fanning is entitled to the 

benefit of all inferences at this stage.  Further, Complaint Counsel provides no evidence to show 

that any consumer made or was likely to make any choice whether or not to participate in the 

Jerk.com siie based on anything expressly or impliedly stated in the legal disclaimer language 

posted on the homepage.  None of the consumer statements submitted by Complaint Counsel 

prove that any consumer was caused to participate or not participate in Jerk.com based on any 

statement contained on the site concerning the origin of content, us.ers, or otherwise. 

Tellingly, not one consumer who submitted a sworn statement indicates actually using 

the site to post content.  The mere fact that consumers wbo viewed content on the site believed 

that it was posted by a friend or family member or could not understand how the information was 

posted, as asserted in the consumer statements, does not establish inducement.  Instead, a review 

of the consumer statements collected by Complaint Counsel show, in essence,· that individuals 

were upset that the information they had posted on Facebook, and believed was private, was 

appearing on Jerk.com. 

All allegations concerning Facebook are irrelevant to the Section 5 claim.  Significantly, 

Complaint Counsel only argues that the allegations pertaining to Facebook establish that the 

{K0565342.1J 

10 

alleged representations were intentionally false.  However, at the same time, Complaint Counsel 

argues thata respondent's intent is wholly-irrelevant in assessing Section 5liability.  The 

Face book allegations do not form any basis for liability in this case and must be stricken. 

Nonetheless, Complaint Counsel's conclusory statements and arguments based on 

counsel' s interpretation ofFacebook's terms of use are of no consequence.  Complaint Counsel 

never segregates specific profiles allegedly "scraped'' from Facebook, as opposed to generated 

by some other source.  Complaint Counsel speculates that profiles appeared on Jerk.com as a 

result of a violation of Facebook policies, which the FTC has no authority to enforce.  Complaint 

Counsel likewise asserts, without admissible evidence, that Jerk, LLC was a party to a valid 

agreement with Facebook.  Even if relevant, the existence of any such binding contractual 

relationship with Facebook is denied.  (Fanning Aff, 1 5).  Complaint Counsel also relies 

primarily upon the allegations contained in Facebook's legal cease and desist letter to Jerk, LLC 

as the basis for a violation.  Such a bogus position, especially on summary decision, cannot 

possibly prevail.  Complaint Counsel is, in fact, attempting to boot-strap the alleged violation of 

Face book terms and conditions as forming the basis of a Section 5 action, as alleged in the 

Complaint  (Complaint, ,, 10-11 ).  Any such arguJ:nent constitutes an unlawful expansion of the 

FTC' s deception authority. 

The irony of Complaint Counsel's position concerning Facebook cannot be overstated. 

The FTC charged Face book with deception by representing to consumers that information posted 

in individual profiles was private with limited accessibility, when Facebook actually made the 

information publicly available through the internet.  The FTC specifically identi£ed information 

that was publicly available, and not actually private contrary to Facebook's representations, 

including user names, profile photos, lists of friends, pages users are fans of: gender, geographic 

{K05653421 ) 

11 

regions, and networks to which users belonged.  This is the exact information that Complamt 

Counsel now contends was accessed improperly and posted on Jerk.com.  Complaint Counsel 

states no legitimate explanation as to how Fanning or Jerk, LLC are liable for deception by 

allegedly posting the exact same information that was publicly available because Facebook made 

it publicly available.  Even if Jerk, LLC or Fanning somehow violated a term and condition of 

use ofFacebook, which is disputed, Complaint Counsel is unable to separate information taken 

from the public domain as opposed to information that may have violated a Facebook policy. 

The FTC also complained that Facebook regularly and by default disclosed "publicly available 

information" to search engines, to Internet users whether or not they used Faceboo~ and other 

third-parties.  Now, Complaint Counsel contends, citing the FTC's regulatory authority, that 

Jerk.com violated the law by accessing and publishing the same information that Facebook 

permitted to be released to the public.  Complaint Counsel's position is not only illogical, but 

meritless. 

Complaint Counsel also fails, as a matter oflaw, to prove conclusively a Section 5 

deception claim based on statements about the benefits of a paid Jerk membership, as generally 

asserted in Count II of the Complaint.  Complaint Counsel improperly styles the claim as one for 

deception, without any basis, because consumers did not sUffer any substantial injury to support 

an unfairness claim as required by the Act.  15 U.S.C. § 45(n).  Count II should be stricken in its 

entirety.  In no way does CoWlt II, related to payment for membership services, permit or justify 

the overly-broad permanent injunctive relief sought in the Proposed Order.  Count II is a total 

throw-in by Complaint Counsel. 

The lack of merit of Count IT is reflected in the vague pieading of the claim and 

arguments made by Complaint Counsel.  The accusations are predicated on a mischaracterization 

{K0565342.1} 

12 

of the circumstances surrounding memberships and payments.  Complaint Counsel comingles 

and interchanges references to enhanced membership benefits, subscriptions, and the ability to 

dispute or remove posted information from profiles.  The facts cited indicate no such 

representations by Jerk, LLC or Fanning posted on the website.  With no specific ''claim" cited 

by Complaint Counsel, no deception exists.  The mere fact that Complaint Counsel cites to 

testimony wherein Fanning allegedly discussed internally charging fees does not constitute a 

material representation relied upon by any consumer.  Complaint Coun$el combines all ofthese 

various statements from various sources, including upset consumers, to conflate a representation. 

Sometimes there is a reference to a $30.00 charge, and other times $2.00 to $5.00 per month is 

quoted.  ''Impressions" of consumers or FTC investigators are insufficient to prove undisputed 

facts supporting an actual false representation that was material. 

The evidence does not conclusively establish that memberships did not exist, or that there 

were no actual subscdptions, or that the only way to remove a post was by paying money.  It is 

just as likely that the failure to deliver so-called memberships, subscriptions, or pass'words could 

have been the result oftechnicalproblems with tbe site.  Indeed, Jerk, LLCrefunded payments to 

disappointed consumers who reported problems with the site.  Of the 85 million profiles that 

Complaint Counsel claims were posted on Jerk. com, only a handful of consumers, at best, 

aPParently were not satisfied.  Moreover, the evidence establishes that profiles were removed 

from the site at the request of consumers, law enforcement, and the FTC thereby establishing no 

nexus between payment of money and removal of a profile, as Complaint Counsel assumes, 

infers, and concludes.  Complaint Counsel has not established a clear pattern or practice of 

deception.  Instead, the evidence shows that there was a legitimate process for rectifying 

complaints and removing profiles, notwithstanding Complaint Counsel's exaggeration. 

{K0565342.1) 

13 

Finally, Fanning identifies the following categories of alleged facts identified by 

Complaint Counsel which unequivocally do not and cannot sustain a ~ection 5 deception claim 

as a matter of law and FTC regulatory policy: 

Statements purportedly made by and between Fanning, interns, web 

(i) 
designers, or other individuals to potential investors or other financial contacts 
within the technology investment community by email or otherwise, including 
statements contained in an alleged Executive Summary and other materials 
undeniably circulated for investment or internal promotional purposes, and not 
conveyed to or involving consumers (CCSMF, ~11" 47, 49, 59, 90); 

(u) 
Statements purportedly made by and between Fanning to interns, web 
designers, programniers, or other individuals working on the Jerk. com project, 
and uot conveyed to or involving consumers (CCSMF, mf 47, 54, 58); 

(iii)  Observations made by or the understandings, beliefs, or impressions of 
interns, programmers, web designers, and other consultants working on the 
project about the scope, development, and purpose of the site, and not conveyed 
to or involving consumers (CCSMF, ~[ 48, 55, 57, 58, 60, 90); and, 

Statements made by and between legal counsel to Jerk, LLC to Complaint 

(iv) 
Counsel, third-parties, law enforcement, or other attorneys in response to 
discovery demands, cease and desist demands, or other legal proceedings 
(CCSMF, 1f 50). 

None of the above can be considered in the context of either the motion for summary 

decision or when the case proceeds to trial on the merits, because they do not involve 

communications directed to any conSUlller.  No reasonable consumer could have acted on any 

statement that was not publicly communicated.  Consequently, Section 5 is not triggered. 

Permitting Complaint Counsel to establish deception liability based on alleged internal 

communications within Jerk, LLC or communications involving non-consumers would turn the 

FTC's stated policy on deception on its head, and create an entirely new theory ofFTC 

regulatory authority aimed at statements that never reach the public domain.  Instead, Complaint 

Counsel's sole purpose of including this irrelevant information, most of which does not even 

constitute admissible evidence, is to portray Fanning in a false negative light and to play upon 

{!<Oi6S342.1 } 

14 

the emotions of the finder of fact.  Complaint Col.Ulsel does a fine job of character assassination, 

but fails to establish a legally-cognizable Section 5 claim. 

2. 

Complaint Counsel cannot lawfully regulate the content of 
free public expression of thoughts, opinions, and ideas 

In reality, this case is being driven by the substantive content of individual profiles on 

Jerk.com, not "claims" about the source of the content.  Complamt Col.Ulsel is offended by or 

uncomfortable with the actual content of the individual profiles appearing on the Jerk.com site, 

and the alleged practice of Jerk. com posting publicly available information allegedly obtained 

from Facebook.  Complaint Counsel dedicates numerous proposed findings of fact to a 

description of the content on the Jerk.com site, from photographs to personal information, as 

well as allegations pertaining to Facebook and its policies.  Control of content far exceeds the 

Commission's regulatory authority and is unlawful. 

Complaint Counsel fails to provide any basis for the FTC's authority within it regulatory 

mandate to determine what is proper content of an individual's profile.  It is not a violation of 

Section 5 to call someone a jerk, or to invite dialogue and conversatioh about personal traits of 

an individuaL  Jerk.com provided a platform to exchange opinions and ideas in the free-flow of 

human relationships at the essence of social media.  Each and every day, media outlets, pundits, 

newspaper editors, and talk show hosts opine on stories involving individuals, and provide 

personal views on people and events.  Censorship and compression oftbe free flow of ideas and 

opinions is abhorrent to a democratic society, whereas the freedom of expression is the bedrock 

of the First Amendment.  Complaint Counsel has no right to regulate, control, or halt the 

exchange and flow of ideas and iofonnation that is at the core of First Amendment freedoms. 

See, e.g., Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762-753  (1972) (First Amendment includes the 

light to ''receive information and ideas" and freedom of speech "necessarily protects the right to 

{K0565)42, 1} 

15 

receive."); Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 575 (Blackmun, J._,  concurring) ("If the First Amendment 

guarantee means anything~ it means that, absent a clear and present danger, government has no 

power to restrict expression because of the effect its message is likely to have on the public."); 

Linmark Assocs .. Inc. v.Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64,74-75 (1964) ("speech concerning public 

affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.") 

Complaint Counsel incorrectly attempts to portray the conduct as commercial speech 

subject to restraint.  Commercial speech is defined as "expression related solely to the economic 

interests of the speaker and its audience.''  Cent. Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. 

Comm'n of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 561  (1980).  Even commercial speech is protected from 

government repression.  See Virginia St. Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer 

Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 762-764 (1976) (commercial speech protected by First Amendment 

because "consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information" may be "as keen,, if not 

keener by far, than his interest in the day's most urgent political debate.").  Nevertheless, the 

speech actually championed by Jerk, LLC does not involve solely economic interests necessary 

to constitute commercial speech.  Rather, the speech protected is the flow of information and 

public dialogue, including by posting a statement on the internet that someone is or acted like a 

jerk, and then receiving broader feedback on the opinions.  The speech is not aimed at causing 

any consumer to act or rely for commercial purposes, or to generate revenue.  It is aimed at 

criticizing, commenting on, and taking issue with individuals and points of view.  Jerk, LLC had 

an absolute right to provide a forum for open public speech and debate despite Complaint 

Counsel's disagreement with the content of the views and opinions of citizens.  Complaint 

Counsel cannot stand as the arbiter of proper conversation between and among users, and cannot 

prevent the flow of information under the preteJ~.'t of protecting against deception.  See Linmark 

{K0565342, 1} 

16 

Assocs., Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85, 96 (1977) (striking ordinance banning t•for sale,  signs 

on residential property enacted for the goal of promoting stable, racially integrated housing, 

where Court found that the town council unlawfully "acted to prevent its residents from 

obtaining certain information" and "sought to restrict the free flow of data" out of fear that 

homeowners would leave town). 

Jerk, LLC also provided a public referendum on Facebook, which also triggers essential 

First Amendment concepts.  In addition to having the unfettered, lawful right to post and re-

publish information that Facebook placed in the public domain, Jer~ LLC exercised the right to 

expose the falsity ofFacebook's representations that all information posted was private.  Jerk, 

LLC was not competing with Facebook for economic benefit; it was examining and exposing 

Facebook.  Jerk, LLC showed thatFacebook, the anointed darling of the social media world, was 

a sham on the issue of user privacy.  The proclamations of privacy made by Facebook to increase 

its user base, and its revenue, were false and Jerk, LLC had an absolute right to expose them as 

false, just as the FTC did in bringing its enforcement action against Facebook.  Public exposure 

serves the public interes~ and increases competition in an open economy.  Although Jerk, LLC's 

activities of exposing Facebook do not implicate commercial speech, the central First 

Amendment tenet of generating marketplace discussion reigns supreme even where commercial 

speech is involved.  Virginia Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 763 (society has a strong interest "in the 

free flow of commercial information" critical to a free market economy). 

Complaint Counsel's claims, which seek to quell speech and bolster Facebook, are 

unlawful and ~ti-competitive at their core, in direct contravention of the FTC's primary 

mandate to prevent methods of unfair competition to promote a level economic playing field. 

' 

Jerk, LLC merely seized the opportunity to force Facebookto realize its own short-falls. 

{K05'65342.1l 

17 

Facebook's claims of privacy were a hook that lured consumer users and investors alike.  Jerk, 

LLC did not just state publicly that such promises were false.  Jerk~ LLC showed it.  Shining the 

light on marketplace activity is the bedrock of free trade and a healthy economy.  Any 

government interference is abhorrent to core freedoms.  As Justice Brandeis once forcefully and 

artfully opined: 

If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and falacies, to avert 
the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to he applied js more speech 1 
not enforced silence. 

Whitney v. Califottria, 274 U.S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). 

3. 

Complaint Counsel's theory ofliability unlawfully e:1.-pands the 
FTC's regulatory reach contrary to its own prior r ulings 

The FTC's observations in the case ofFTC v. ReverseAuction.com, Inc., 2000 US Dist. 

LEXIS 20761 (D.D.C. 2000) bear on Complaint Counsel's unlawful expansion of regulatory 

authority in the present action.2  The FTC asserted that ReverseAuction, a competing auction 

site, willfully misled eBay by registering as an eBay user and representing that it would comply 

with the terms and conditions of eBay's User Agreement, including the agreement to refrain 

from using any personal identifying information of any eBay user obtained through the site for 

sending unsolicited commercial e-mails.  T~e findings of the Commissioners in approving the 

Complaint are compelling and relevant to this case.  Commissioners Swindle and Leary, 

concurring and dissenting in part, stated as follows: 

ReverseAuction  represented  to  eBay  that  it  would  not  use  the  information  it 
obtained  about  other  members 
to  send  unsolicited  commercial  e~mail. 
Reve.rseAuction, however, sent unsolicited e-mails promoting its auction site to 
eBay members using e-mail addresses harvested from eBay's site. ReverseAuction 
thereby deceived eBay directly and, in doing so, also misled other members of the 
eBay community who believed that all participants in the eBay marketplace would 
abide by the same privacy roles.

'I 

We recognize that the  Commission's  decision to proceed  against the  deception 
alleged in Count One could be construed as placing the Commission in the position 
of enforcing eBay's privacy policy. Nevertheless,  we want to emphasize that our 
decision  to  challenge  ReverseAuction's  deception is  an  effort to  buttress,  not 
supplant or detract from, initiatives of private parties (like eBay) who develop and 
implement their own privacy  arrangements.  We  further  believe that  it is  in the 
public interest for the Commission to pursue the deception allegation in Count One 
because such deceptive conduct undermines consumer confidence in the nascent 
electronic  marketplace  at  a  critical  point in  time  and  may  thereby  inhibit its 
development. 

See Statement of Commissioners Orson Swindle and Thomas B. Leary Concurring in Part 

and Dissenting in Part, in ReverseAuction.com, Inc., File No. 0023046 (attached to Carr Aff., at 

These observations, analyses, and conclusions evidence the unlawful expansion of 

regulatory authority practiced by Complaint Counsel in this case.  Perhaps most significantly, the 

Commission ultimately approved taking action Wlder the FTC's deception jurisdiction because 

ReverseAuction made affinnati:ve misrepresentations to eBay about compliance with terms of 

use, which the FTC concluded had an impact on consumers.  Here, Jerk, LLC and Fanning made 

no such representations to Facebook.  The Commissioners in ReverseAuction seemed to bend 

over backwards to justify enforcement action, particularly to protect the emerging electronic 

.tna.rketplace that existed at that specific time in 2000.  Years have now passed, and the electronic 

marketplace, including the social media space, cannot possibly be described as "nascent" 

requiring protection.  There exists no need to protect and coddle Facebook, the publicly-traded 

multi-media giant that dominates the space, in the ever-evolving and fast-paced competitive 

~ocial media marketplace.  Further, regulatory enforcement in this instance is inimical to 

Facebook's policies that absolutely did not promote and protect individual privacy, as the FTC 

specifically charged in filing its Complaint against Face book.  Commissioner Swindle

emphasized that "our decision to challenge ReverseAuction's deception is an effort to buttress, 

not supplant or detract from, initiatives of private parties (like eBay) who develop and implement 

their own privacy arrangements.''  According to the Commission's own allegations, Facebook 

did not develop and implement "privacy arrangements" aimed at protecting the public from 

disclosure.  There is nothing to buttress, using Commissioner Swindle's words, with respect to 

Facebook' s policy of making infonnat:ion readily accessible to the public through the internet. 

The interests underlying the novel decision reached in ReverseAuction, which governed the 

FTC's decision to approve expanded Section 5 authority in that case, are not present here. 

The significant evolution of the statutory landscape with respect to data privacy, internet 

security, and technology since the ReverseAuction case further cements the refusal to ehiend 

Section 5 deception authority under the facts and circumstances in this specific case.  Congress 

has supplanted, and even preempted, the FTC's regulatory authority in the data privacy and 

security space by enacting a host oflaws and regulations that govern on-line activities.  See, e.g., 

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 4 The Fair Credit Repo1ting Act, 5 The Gramm-Leach-

Bliley Act,6 The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act/ and The Cable Television Consumer 

Protection and Competition Act8•  Consequently, the field of on-line data and infonnation 

including data privacy is completely occupied by other agencies empowered to regulate and 

establish rights and obligations with respect to internet privacy and data, and the FTC is out.

C.  Whether Fanning Controlled Jerk, LLC is a Fact Question 

The concept of'' control" over any entity or organization for the purpose of imposing 

Section 5 liability is essentially grounded in traditional notions of common law agency.  Agency 

is a question of fac~ and must be detennined by the finder of fact upon weighing all facts and 

circumstances concerning the scope of the agency relationship with the principal.  See White's 

Fann Dairy, Inc. v. DeLaval Separator Company, 433 F.2d 63, 66-67 (1st Cir. 1970) (citations 

omitted) (proof of agency is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury).  Here, there exists a 

healthy dispute as to the scope of Fanning's authority as an agent ofNetCapital.com, LLC 

through which Fanning served as an advisor to Jerk, LLC, and any concomitant control over 

Jerk, LLC within the agency relationship.  Fanning, individually, did not have express authority 

to control Jerk, LLC or Jerk. com.  Jerk, LLC was not a typical company with a specific corporate 

or ownership management structure with ongoing employee relationships and designated titles. 

Jerk, LLC was a fledgling internet technology company that changed as the business model and 

operations evolved.  Fanning, at all times, acted within the corporate context and within the 

limited authority granted.  Fanning, individually, took no action with respect to Jerk, LLC. 

Complaint Counsel's leap that Fanning is personally and individually liable for the 

actions and conduct of Jerk, LLC eviscerates all notions of corporate existence.  NetCapital.com. 

LLC, as a finn, provided guidance and assistance to Jerk, LLC, as a technology start-up. 

Exposing Fanning to personal liability for actions taken on behalfNetCapital.com, LLC with 

respect to Jerk, LLC unlawfully ignores the corporate structure.  Complaint Counsel provides no 

evidence to substantiate or support such a corporate veil-piercing theory of liability.  Imposing 

liability on individuals acting within a corporate capacity for the acts of the principal company 

violates notions of agency and corporate existence.  If the theory of personal liability fashioned 

{K0565342.1} 

21 

by Complaint Counsel is permitted to stand, each and every enforcement action by the FTC 

against a company necessarily will trigger individual liability, because companies can only act 

through individuals.  Further, every officer or employee of any private equity or venture capital 

:firm that invests in a technology start-up would suffer possible individual liability merely 

because the firm manages a portfolio company that ends up in the cross-hairs of an FTC 

investigation.  Complaint Counsel' s argument turns otherwise exceptional, limited circumstances 

of individual liability into the rule governing all FTC enforcement actions.  Such a broad 

standard would stymie investment and have a huge negative impact on the economy.  This is bad 

public policy, and cannot possibly be consistent with the expectations of Congress when it 

granted the FTC its regulatory mandate. 

Moreover, the true focus of this case is control over website content and statements made 

on Jerk.com, and not control over Jerk, LLC as an entity.  Specifically, a valid dispute exists as 

to whether the content about consumers that existed on the Jerk.corn site rested within Fanning's 

purview as an advisor to Jerk, LLC through NetCapital.com, LLC.  Fanning did not write any 

software code for Jerk, LLC to operate Jerk.com, and did not place any consumer content on 

Jerk. com,  Fanning was not a software developer or web developer for Jerk, LLC.  Fanning had 

no authority over or advisory agreement with the primary developers of the Jerk, LLC software. 

Jerk.com essentially was operated and controlled by Louis Lardass of Internet Domains, which 

owned the Jerk.com domain, and foreign software developers who were reportedly supported by 

various intems, college students, and other independent contractors working for their own 

benefit.  Complaint Counsel does not establish that Fanning, or even Jerk, LLC, was responsible 

for or controlled any of the statements on the site.  Rather, Complaint Counsel draws the illogical 

inference that Fanning controlled Jerk, LLC and therefore Fanning must have controlled content. 

{K0565342.1) 

22 

Nothing in the law, however, permits Complaint Counsel merely to impute the content of the 

Jerk. com site to Fanning.  Complaint Counsel also ignores Fanning is entitled to the benefit of all 

inferences for the purposes of summary decision.  Even ifF anning was involved at the level 

Complaint Counsel postures, the legal test is not facilitation or encouragement, but rather a more 

stringent standard requiring a conclusive showing that Fanning "participated directly in the 

practices or acts or had authority to control them."  FfC v. Amv Travel Serv .. Inc., 875 F.2d 564, 

573 (7th Cir. 1989).  Complaint Counsel fails to meet this high standard. 

Directly to the point, Complaint Counsel presents no admissible evidence that Fanning. 

individually, directed or controlled the Romanian developers whom Complaint Counsel contends 

were managing the content and other technical aspects of the project.  Complaint Counsel cites to 

testimony from a former intern that completely undercuts the theory of Fanning's ultimate 

control, as follows: "A third idea championed, by software engineers from a Romanian finn 

called Software Assist, was that we generate profiles on Jerk. com by bulk-loading user 

information from Facebook."  (CX0057-002).  Complaint Counsel merely piles inference upon 

inference to reach the conclusion that Fanning must be responsible.  Such bare assertions fail in 

the face of contradictory evidence, including presented through Complaint Counsel's own 

witnesses.  Much of the so-called evidence relied upon by Complaint Counsel is actually rank 

speculation, belief, and multi-level hearsay all of which is not admissible evidence.  A live issue 

exjsts about the scope of Fanning's agency and control, which must be decided by the :finder of 

fact on a full record after weighing credibility.  Summary decision is not appropriate as a matter 

oflaw on the issue of Fanning's personal liability.  See Ross,, at* 4 (''Notwithstanding the fact 

that the FTC's evidence is substantial, at this stage of the litigation, this Court is unable to 

conclusively determine whether the FTC is entitled to summary judgment against Kristy Ross 

{K0565342.l J 

23 

because to do so would require this Court to make credibility findings, inferences, and findings 

of fact that are more properly made in the conte:A't of a bench trial. ").9 

D. 

The Relief Sought by Complaint Counsel is Unlawful 

Even if summary disposition in violation of Fanning's due process rights is granted, the 

broad relief requested by Complaint Counsel in the Proposed Order far exceeds proper 

regulatory authority and cannot enter.  It is nearly impossible even to comment upon and address 

the legal merits of the requested relief where it is so broad and expansive and relies upon the 

unspecified nature of the claims asserted.  This is not a situation where an order restricting or 

deterring certain future claims about a product or service is even possible where there is no 

specific advertisement or mode of presenting a claim present.  Moreover, the request seeks 

remedies unrelated to any alleged conduct.  For instance, Complaint Counsel requests an order 

pertaining to misrepresentation of privacy protections despite no mention or reference to such 

allegations in the Complaint  While injunctive relief entered under the FTC Act may be broad, it 

must bear a reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to have occurred.  Litton 

Industries, Inc. v. FTC, 676 F.2d 364, 370 (9th Cir. 1982), citing FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 
380 u.s. 374, 394-95 (1965). 

Complaint Counsel's knee-jerk JrrQ forma request to restrain for twenty (20) or even ten 

(10) years Fanning's involvement with respect to each and every actual or potential business 

venture involving the internet, public information, or personal data without exception or any 

degree of specificity fails to consider the seriousness and deliberateness of the violation, the ease 

9  Complaint Counsel bas made much of the fact that "Respondents" allegedly flouted the Civil Investigative 
Demand process and failed to answer discovery in the litigation, again seeking to prevail based on the drawing of 
adverse inferences.  Putting aside Complaint Counsel's miscbardcterizations, "Respondents"' conduct throughout 
the course of the proceedings does not permit the granting of summary judgment.  See~ at * 6 (refusing to grant 
summary judgment based on an adverse inference where respondent asserted Fifth Amendment privilege and failed 
to provide any meaningful discovery). 

{K0565342. l} 

24 

in which the violative claim may be transferred to other products, and whether Fanning has any 

history of prior violations as mandated to support such .sweeping relief.  See FTC v.John Beck 

Amazing Profits, 888 F.Supp.2d 1006, 1012 (C.D. CaL 2012) (citations omitted).  The Proposed 

Order lacks specificity, and is unlawful  Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. at 393 (FTC orders 

should be "as specific as the circumstances will pennit"); FTC v. Henrv Brach &  Co., 368 U.S. 

360, 367-68 (1962) (FTC orders must be sufficiently precise to "avoid raising serious questions 

as to their meaning and application").  Even so-called ''fencing in" pro-visions must bear a 

"reasonable relation to the unlawful practices found to exist.''  Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 

at 394-95 (footnote omitted).  See also Standard Oil of California v. FTC, 577 F.2d 653, 663 (9th 

Cir.  1978) (court rejected order that applied to all of respondent's products, not just those 

involved in the violation, absent circumstances justifying broad coverage, such as a long history 

of violations). 

The most chilling aspect of the Proposed Order is the prior restraint over free speech, 

including restriction on use and dissemination of information gathered from public sources. 

Imposing any restrictions on the use and publication of any information, whether in a 

commercial setting or otherwise, is an extreme abrogation ofF anning' s First Amendment rights 

and privileges.  Complaint Counsel intends to restrain in advance all future speech, no matter the 

content or purpose.  Complaint Counsel impermissibly ignores that only commercial speech that 

is "actually misleading" may be prohibited in its entirety.  In re R.M.J.. 455  U.S. 191, 203 

(1982).  Government is barred from placing an absolute prohibition on potentially misleading 

information.  Wine &  Spirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 481  F.3d 1, 8~9 (1st Cir. 2007) 

(citations omitted).  Taken literally, the injunction sought against Fanning would bar him from 

commenting on or utilizing any information that exists or potentially exist.<> in the public domain, 

{K0565342.1} 

25 

and effectively prohibits or regulates Fanning from engaging in any business that involves social 

media or the internet.  Complaint Counsel's proposed order, as drafted, would even unlawfully 

regulate or prohibit Fanning from making or publishing statements that are true.  See Cotherman 

v. FTC. 417 F.2d 587,595-596 (5th Cir.  1969).  Complaint Counsel is barred from repressing 

speech and expression by Fanning, and the relief requested must be rejected in its entirety.  See 

. 

Beneficial Com. v.  FTC, 542 F.2d 611, 619-620 (3rd Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 983 

( 1977) ("The Conunission, like any governmental agency, .must start from the premise that any 

prior restraint is suspect, and that a remedy, even for deceptive advertising, can go no further 

than is necessary for the elimination of the deception."). 

At a minimum, relief should not be adjudicated in summary fashion on this record. 

Complaint Counsel must be required to justify the broad relief requested with specificity, instead 

of through sweeping statements and citations to ''fencing in" cases that have no legitimate 

application to this instant action.  Numerous fact issues remain unresolved.  Fanning must have a 

right to address and defend against any affirmative proposed order in the spirit of due process, 

with actual notice and an opportunity to be heard.  See FTC v. Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., 

569 F.Supp.2d 285,307 (D.Mass. 2008).

PUBLIC DOCUMENT 

AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN FANNJNG 

I, John Fanning, upon my own personal knowledge, under oath hereby depose and state 

as follows: 

1. 

Jerk. l.LC launched Jerk.com in approximately 2009 as an alternate social media 

and reputational website.  The primary mission of Jerk, LLC was to educate, to provide a 

platform for public dialogue and discussion, and eventually to comment on and to expose 

Facebook's lack of privacy. 

2. 

I  formerly served as an advisor to Jerk, LLC through another company called 

NetCapital.com, LLC, and not in my individual capacity.  NetCapital.com. LLC is a private 

equity/venture capital firm, with a number of partners, that invests in and provides advisory 

services to a wide-range of technology start-ups including those in its portfolio of companies. 

My authority was limited, and at all times I acted on behalf ofNetCapitlaJ.com, LLC with 

respect to Jerk, LLC.  I never acted in my individual capacity. 

3. 

Jerk, LLC, as an internet technology start-up, was not a large company with levels 

of management and regular employees.  Jerk. com essentially was operated and controlled  by 

Louis Lardass of Internet Domains, which owned the Jerk.com domain, and foreign software 

developers who were reportedly supported by various interns, college students, and other 

independent contractors working for their own benefit.  I was not responsible for spearheading 

and operating Jerk, LLC or Jerk. com.  Through and on behalf ofNetCapital.com. LLC, I was 

part of a group involved in efforts to launch, :finance, and ez..'J)and the Jerk brand through the 

Jerk.com website.  1 did not write any software code for Jerk, LLC to operate Jerk.com, and did 

not place any consumer content on Jerk. com.  I was not a software developer or web developer 

{K0565353, I) 

for Jerk, LLC.  I had no authority over or advisory agreement with the primary developers of the 

Jerk, LLC software. 

4. 

Jerk, LLC established an agent) a lawyer in Phoenix, Arizona, to accept service of 

complaints about Jerk. com while Jerk, LLC held a paid option to purchase the domain name.  As 

far as I am aware, Jerk, LLC took action including to remove content from Jerk.com whenever it 

was obligated to do so.  As far as I am aware, Jerk, LLC would refund money to users who 

claimed they had paid but had not received membership services via a web fotm.  Jerk, LLC 

experienced a number of problems in operating the site, including the site being backed and 

being "snaked" by the FTC which disrupted the services.  The FTC also made demands on Jerk, 

LLC to take corrective action.  I understand that Jerk, LLC complied with the FTC's demands, 

although the company denied any liability. 

5. 

Facebook complained that Jerk, LLC was violating its policies and procedures 

concerning use.  Jerk, LLC rejected the allegations.  As far as I am aware, Jerk, LLC never 

violated any valid contract or agreement with Facebookwithrespect to Jerk.com.  Any 

information posted on Jerk. com that Facebook claimed was a violation came from users or 

derived from public sources.  The entire Facebook directory containing user information and 

photographs was readily available to the public through the internet without ever having to agree 

to the Facebook tetms of service, and any user of Jerk. com, or independent third party, could 

have accessed the directory and posted the information on Jerk. com.  Even today, the images and 

names ofFacebook users are freely available to anyone without requiting any agreement with 

Face book or its terms of service simply by going to www.facebook.com/directory.  I never 

hacked into Facebook, and I never directed anyone affiliated with Jerk, LLC to back into 

Facebook with respect to Jerk. com. 

{KOS65353.l} 

6. 

The FTC was upset when I refused to be interviewed as part of its investigation 

prior to the filing ofthe Complaint.  It is my opinion that the FTC's actions and investigations 

are intended to harass, and are a blatant attempt to chill free speech because the nature of that 

speech makes the FTC uncomfortable.  The Government only began to take issue with the 

content published on Jerk. com after the President appeared on the front page during the last 

election cycle. 

7. 

As far as I am aware, Jerk, LLC, while it owned an option to buy the Jerk.com 

domain, never made any false or deceptive claims to consumers or users about the Jerk. com 

website, content, or users.  I know that I did not.

Complaint, Request for Investigation, Injunction, and Other Relief 

I.  Introduction 

1.  This complaint concerns material changes to privacy settings made by Facebook, the 

largest social network service in the United States, which adversely impact users of the 
Facebook service. Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings disclose personal 
information to the public that was previously restricted. Facebook's changes to users' 
privacy settings also disclose personal information to third parties that was previously not 
available. These changes violate user expectations, diminish user privacy, and contradict 
Facebook's own representations. These business practices are Unfair and Deceptive 
Trade Practices, subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission (the "Commission'') 
under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

2.  These business practices impact more than 100 million users of the social networking site 

who fall within the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission.1 

3 .  EPIC urges the Commission to investigate Facebook, determine the extent of the harm to 

consumer privacy and safety, require Facebook to restore privacy settings that were 
previously available as detailed below, require Facebook to gjve users meaningful control 
over personal information, and seek appropriate injunctive and compensatory relief.

4.  The Electronic Privacy Information Center ("EPIC") is a not-for-profit research center 
based in Washington, D.C. EPIC focuses on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues 
and is a leading consumer advocate before the Federal Trade Commission. Among its 
otber activities, EPIC first brought the Commission's attention to the privacy risks of 
online advertising? In 2004, EPIC filed a complaint with tbe FTC regarding the 
deceptive practices of data broker fum Choicepoint, calling the Commission's attention 
to "data products circumvent[ing] the FCRA, giving buslnesses, private investigators, and 
law enforcement access to data that previously had been subjected to Fair Information 
Practices."3 As a result of the EPIC complaint, the FTC fined Choicepoint $15 million. 4 
EPIC initiated the complaint to the FTC regarding Microsoft Passport. 5 The Commission 
subsequently required Microsoft to implement a comprehensive infonnation security 
program for Passport and similar services.6 EPIC also filed a complaint with the FTC 
regarding the marketing of amateur spyware, 7 which resulted in the issuance of a 
permanent injunction bau:ing sales ofCyberSpy's "stalker spyware,'' over-the-counter 
snrveillance technology sold for individuals to spy on other individuals.8

5.  Earlier this year, EPIC urged the FTC to undertake an investigation ofGoogle and cloud 
computing. 9 The FTC agreed to review the complaint, stating that it "raises a number of 
concerns about the privacy and security of infonnation collected from consumers 
online."10 More recently, EPIC asked the FTC to investigate the "parental control" 
software fum EchometrixY Thus far, the FTC has failed to announce any action in this 
matter, but once the Department of Defense became aware of the privacy and security 
risks to military families, it removed Echometrix's software from the Army and Air Force 
Exchange Service, the online shopping portal for military fam.ilies.12

practices alleged herein, has been and is in or affecting commerce, as "commerce" is

m. The Importance of Privacy Protection 

14. The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right in the United States.13 The 

privacy of an individual is direc1ly implicated by the collection, use, and dissemination of 
personal information. The opportunities to secure employment, insurance, and credit, to 
obtain medical services and the rights of due process may be jeopardized by the misuse 
of personal infonnatioiL 14 

13 See Departmenr of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 149, 763 (1989) ("both the 
common law and the literal utlderstandings of privacy encompass the individual's control of information concerning 
his or her person"); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 605 (1977); United States v. Katz, 389 U.S. 347 (1967); Olmstead 
v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). 
14 Fed. Trade Comm'n. Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 11  (2009) (charts describing bow identity theft 
victims' information bave been misused). 

4 

15. The excessive collection of personal data in the United States coupled with inadequate 

legal and technological protections have led to a dramatic increase in the crime of identity 
theft.15 

16. The federal government has established policies for privacy and data collection on federal 

web sites that acknowledge particular privacy concerns ''when uses of web technology 
can track the activities of users over time and across different web sites" and has 
discouraged the use of such techniques by federal agencies.16 

17, As the Supreme Court has made clear, and the Court of Appeals for the District of 

Columbia Circuit bas recently held) "both the common law and the literal understanding 
of privacy encompass the individual's control of information concerning his or her 
person.''17 

. 

18. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Guideli.D.es on 

the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data recognize that "the 
right of individuals to access and challenge personal data is generally regarded as perhaps 
the most .important privacy protection safeguard." 

19. The appropriation tort recognizes the right of each person to protect the commercial v--alue 

of that person's name and likeness. The tort is recognized in virtually every state in the 
United States. 

20. The Madrid Privacy Declaration of November 2009 affinns that privacy is a basic human 

right, notes that "corporations are acquiring vast amounts of personal data without 
independent oversight,, and highlights the critical role played by ''Fair Information 
Practices that place obligations on those who collect and process personal information 
and gives rights to those whose personal information is collected.''18 

21. The Federal Trade Commission is ''empowered and directed" to in.vestigate and prosecute 

violations of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act where the privacy interests 
of Internet users are at issue.19

25. In September 2006, Facebook disclosed users' personal information, including details 

relating to their marital and dating status, without their knowledge or consent through its 
"News Feed" program?4 Hundreds of thousands of users objected to Facebook's 
actions.25 In response, Facebook stated: 

We really messed this one up. When we launched News Feed and Mini(cid:173)
Feed we were trying to provide you with a stream ofinfonnation about 
your social world. Instead, we did a bad job of explailling what the new 
features were and an even worse job of giving you control ofthem.26

and video rentals, without their knowledge or consent through its ''Beacon" program. 27

Fraud and Abuse Act, and California's Computer Crime Law.30 

28. On May 30, 2008, the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic filed a 

complaint with Privacy Commissioner of Canada concerning the "unnecessary and non(cid:173)
consensual collection and use of personal infonnation by Facebook."31 

29. On July 16,2009, the Privacy Commissioner's Office found Facebook "in contravention" 

of Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.32 

30. The Privacy Commissioner's Office found: 

Facebook did not have adequate safeguards in place to prevent 
unauthorized access by application developers to useiS' personal 
information, and furthennore was not doing enough to ensure that 
meaningful consent was obtained from individuals for the disclosure of 
their personal information to application developers.33 

31. On February 4, 2009, Facebookrevised its Tenns of Service, asserting broad, permanent, 

and retroactive rights to users' personal information-even after they deleted their 
accounts.34 Facebook stated that it could make public a user's "name, likeness and image 
for any purpose, including commercial or advertising.''35 

32. Users objected to Facebook's actions, andFacebook reversed the revisions on the eve of 

an EPIC complaint to the Commission. 36 

28 In Lane v. Faceboolc,  Inc., No. 5;08-CV ·03845 (N.D. Cal. filed Aug. 12, 2008), Facebook bas requested court 
approval of a class action settlement that would terminate users' claims, but provide no monetaxy compensation to 
users. The court bas not ruled on the matter.

Changes in Privacy Settings: ''PubUcly Available Information" 

33. Facebook updated its privacy policy and changed the privacy settings available to users 

on November 19,2009 and again on December 9, 2009.37 

34. Facebook now treats the following categories of personal data as "publicly available 

information:" 

•  users' names, 
•  profile photos, 
• 
lists of friends, 
•  pages they are fans of: 
•  gender, 
•  geographic regions, and 
•  networks to which they belong.38 

35. By default, Facebook discloses '1>ublicly available information'' to search engines, to 
Internet users whether or not they use Facebook, and others. According to Facebook, 
such information can be accessed by "every application and website, including those you 
have not connected with ... .'.39 

36. Prior to these changes, only the following items were mandatorily "publicly available 

information:" 

•  a user's name and 
•  a user's network.

39. Facebook's ChlefPrivacy Officer, Chris Kelly, testified before Congress thatFacebook 

gives ''users controls over how they share their personal infonn.ation that model real(cid:173)
world infonnation sharing and provide them transparency about how we use their 
infoo:nation in advertising:..to Kelly further testified, "many of our users choose to limit 
what profile information is available to non-friends. Users have extensive and precise 
controls available to choose who sees what among their networks and friends, as well as 
tools that give them the choice to make a limited set of information available to search 
engines and other outside entities:.41 

40. In an ''hnportant message from Facebook," Facebook told users it was giving ''you more 
control of your information . .. and [bad] added the ability to set privacy on everything 

share ... " as the screen from the transition tool illustrates:

settings after the transition from the original privacy settings to the revised settings made 
public his photographs and other information. 42

43. Providing false information on a Facebook profile violates Facebook's TeiJDS of 

Service.44 

44. Facebook user profile information may include sensitive personal information. 

45. Facebook users can indicate that they are "fans" of various organizations, individuals, 

and products, mcluding controversial political causes.45 

46. Under the origjnal privacy settings, users controlled public access to the causes they 

supported. Under the revised settings, Facebook has made users' causes "publicly 
available information," disclosing this data to others and preventing users from exercising 
control as they bad under the original privacy policy. 

47. Based on profile data obta.inedfromFacebook users' friends lists, MIT researchers found 

that "just by looking at a person's online friends, they could predict whether the person 
was gay.'.-46 Under Facebook's original privacy policy, Facebook did not categorize 
users' friends lists as "publicly available information." Facebook now makes users' 
friends lists "publicly available information." 

48. Dozens of American Face book users, who posted political messages critical oflnm, have 

reported that Iranian authorities subsequently questioned and detained their relatives.47 
Under the revised privacy settings, Facebook makes such users' friends lists publicly 
available.

49. According to the Wall Street Journal, one Iranian-American graduate student received a 
threatening email that read, "we know your home address in Los Angeles," and directed 
the user to "stop spreading lies about Iran on Facebook.',48 

50. Another U.S. Facebook user who criticized Iran on Facebook stated that security agents 

in Tehran located and arrested his father as a result of the postings. 49 

51. One Facebook user who traveled to Iran said that secmity officials asked him whether he 
owned a Facebook account, and to verify his answer, they peiformed a Google search for 
his name, which revealed his Facebook page. His passport was 'subsequently confiscated 
for one month, pending interrogation. 5° 

52. Many Iranian Facebook users, out of fear for the safety of their family and friends, 

changed their last name to "Irani'' on their pages so government officials would have a 
more difficult time targeting them and their loved ones. 51 

53. By implementing the revised privacy settings, Facebook discloses users' sensitive friends 
lists to the public and exposes users to the analysis employed by Iranian officials against 
political opponents. 

Changes to Privacy Settings: Information Disclosure to Application Developers 

54. The Fac~book Platform transfers Facebook users' personal data to application developers 

2 
without users' knowledge or consent. 5

55. Facebook permits third-party applications to. access user information at the moment a 

user visits an application website. According to Facebook, third party applications 
receive publicly available infonnation automatically when you visit them, and additional 
information when you formally authorize or connect your Facebook account with 
them."53 

56. As Facebook itself explains m its documentation, when a user adds an application, by 
default that application then gains access to everything on Facebook that the user can.

see. 54 The primary ')>rivacy setting" that Facebook demonstrates to third-party 
developers governs what other users can see from the application's output, rather than 
what data may be accessed by the application. ss 

57. According to Facebook: 

Examples of the types of information that applications and websites may 
have access to include the following information, to the extent visible on 
Facebook: your name, your profile picture, your gender, your birthday, 
your hometown location (city/state/country), your current location 
(city/state/country), your political view, your activities, your interests, 
your musical preferences, television shows in which you are interested, 
~ovies in which you are interested, books in which you are interested,_ 
your favorite quotes, your relationship status, your dating interests, your 
relationship interests, your network affiliations, your education history, 
your wo.tk history, your course information, copies of photos in your 
photo albums, metadata associated with .your photo albums (e.g., time of 
upload, album name, comments on your photos, etc.), the total number of 
messages sent and/or received by you, the total number of unread 
messages in your in-box, the total mnnber of "pokes" you have sent and/or 
received, the total number of wall posts on your Wall, a list of user IDs 
mapped to your friends, your social timeline, notifications that you have 
received from other applications, and events associated with your 
profile. 56 

58. To access this information, developers use 1h.e Facebook Application 

Programming Interface ('' APY'), to ''utiliz[ e] profile, friend, Page, group, photo, 
and event data.',s7  The API is a collection of commands that an application can 
run on Facebook, including authorization commaD.ds, data retrieval commands, 
8 
and data publishing commands. 5

59. Third-parties who develop Facebook applications may also transmit the user information 
they access to their own servers, and are asked only to retain the information for less than 
24 hours.59 

60. A 2007 University ofVrrginia study ofFacebook applications found that "90.7% of 

applications are being given more privileges than they need.''60 

61. According to the Washington Post, many Facebook developers who have gained access 
to information this way have considered the ''value" of having the data, even when the 
data is not relevant to the purpose for whic'h the user bas added the application. 61 

62. Under the revised privacy policy, Facebook now categorizes users' names, profile photos, 
lists of friends, pages they are fans of, gender, geographic regions, andnetworks to which 
they belong as "publicly available information," and Facebooks sets the "default privacy 
setting for certam types of information [users] post on F acebook ... to 'everyone. "'62 

63. Facebook allow~ user information that is categorized as publicly available to "everyone" 

to be: "accessed by everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into 
Facebook);" made subject to "indexing by third party search engines;" "associated with 
you outside ofFacebook (such as when you visit other sites on the internet);" and 
"imported and exported by us and others without privacy limitations."63 

64. With the Preferred Developer Program, Facebook will give third-party developers access 
to a user•s primary email address, personal information provided by the user to Facebook 
to subscribe to the Facebook service, but not necessarily available to the public or to 
developers. 64  In fac~ some users may choose to create a Facebook account precisely to 
prevent the disclosure of their primary email address.

65. Facebook states in the revised privacy policy that users can "opt-out ofFacebook 

Platform and Face book Connect altogether through [their] privacy settings.'' 65 Face book 
further states that, "you can control how you share infonnation with those third-party 
applications and websites through your application settings.>'66 

66. In fact, under the original privacy settings, users had a one-click option to prevent the 

disclosure of personal information to third party application developers through the 
Facebook API, as the screenshot below indicates:

68. Under the revised settings, even when a user uncbecks all boxes and indicates that none 

of the personal information listed above should be disclosed to third party application 
developers, Facebook states that '•applications will always be able to access your publicly 
available information (Name, Profile Picture, Gender, Current City, Networks, Friend 
List, and Pages) and information that is visible to Everyone.'.68 

69. Facebook's "Everyone" setting overrides the user's choice to limit access by third-party 

applications and websites. 

70. Facebook does not now provide the option that explicitly allows users to opt out of 

disclosing all information to third parties through the Face book Platform. 

71. Users can block individual third-party applications from obtaining personal information 

by searching the Application Directory, visiting the application's "abouf' page, clicking a 
small link on that page, and then confirming their decision. 69 A user would have to 
perform these steps for each of more than 3 50,000 applications in order to block all of

Facebook Users Oppose the Changes to the Privacy Settings 

72. Facebook users oppose these changes. In only four days, the number ofFacebook groups 

related to privacy settings grew to more than five hundred. 71 Many security experts, 
bloggers, consumer groups, and news organizations have also opposed these changes. 

73. More than 1,050 Facebook users are members of a group entitled "Against The New 

FacebookPrivacy Settings!" The group has a simple request: 'We demand that Fa.cebook 
stop forcing people to reveal things they don't feel comfortable revealing.'m 

74. More than 950 Facebook users are members of a group entitled "Face book! Fix the 

Privacy Settings," which exhorts users to "tell Facebook that our personal information :is 
private, and we want to control it!'m

75. More than 74,000 Facebook users are members of a group entitled ''Petition: Facebook, 

stop invading my privacy!"74 The group objects to the revisions and hopes to "get a 
message across to Facebook"75 The group description explains, "[o]n December 9, 2009 
Facebook once again breached our privacy by imposing new 'privacy settings' on 365+ 
million users. These settings notably give us LESS privacy than we had before, so I ask, 
how exactly do they make us more secure? ... . Perhaps the most frustrating and 
troublesome part is the changes Facebook made on our behalf without truly making us 
aware or even asking us. "76 

76. A Facebook blog post discussing the changes to Facebook's privacy policy and settings 

drew 2,000 comments from users, most of them critical of the changes.77 One commenter 
noted, ''I came here to communicate with people with whom I have some direct personal 
connection; not to have my personal informatio~ provided to unscrupulous third party 
vendors and made available to potential stalkers and identity tbieves."78 Another 
commented, "I liked the old privacy settings better. I felt safer and felt like I had more 
control."79 

77. The Electronic Frontier Foundation posted commentary online discussing the "good, the 
bad, and the ugly" aspects ofFacebook's revised privacy policy and settings. More than 
400 people have "tweeted'' this article to encourage Facebook users to readEFF's 
analysis. 80 

78. The American Civil Liberties Union ofNorthem California's Demand Your dotRights 

campaign started a petition to Facebook demanding thatFacebook (1) give full control of 
user information back to users; (2) give users strong default privacy settings; and (3) 
restrict the access of1hird party applications to user data.81 1be ACLU is ''concerned that

the changes Facebook has made actually remove some privacy controls and encourage 
Facebook users to make other privacy protections disappear."82

. 

79. In the past week, more than 3,000 blog posts have been written focusing on criticism oi 

Facebook's privacy changes.83 

80. After rolling out the revised Facebook privacy settings, widespread user criticism of the 
change in the ''view friends" setting prompted Facebook to roll back the changes in part: 
"In response to your feedback, we've improved the Friend List visibility option described 
below. Now when you uncheck the 'Show my friends on my prof.tle' option in the 
Friends box. on your profile, your Friend List won't appear on your profile regardless of 
whether people are viewing it while logged into Facebook or logged out." Facebook 
further stated that "this information is still publicly available, however, and can be 
accessed by applications."84 

81. Ed Felten, a security expert and Princeton University professor, 85  stated: 

As a user myself: I was pretty unhappy about the recently changed privacy 
control. I felt thatFacebook was trying to trick me into loosening controls 
on my information. Though the initial letter from Face book founder Mark 
Zuck:erberg painted the changes as pro-privacy ... the actual effect of the 
company's suggested new policy was to allow more public access to 
infollllation. Though the company has backtracked on some of the 
changes, problems remain. 86 

82. Joseph Bonneau, a security expert and University of Cambridge researcher, criticized 

Facebook's disclosure of users' friend lists, observing, 

there have been many research papers, including a few by me and 
colleagues in Cambridge, concluding that [friend lists are] actually the 
most important information to keep private. The threats here are more

cross-network de-anonymisation, socially targeted phisbing and scams.87 

Bonneau predicts that Facebook '\villlikely be completely crawled fairly soon by 
professional data aggregators, and probably by enterprising researchers soon 
after_,ss 

83. Security expert89 Graham Cluley stated: 

if you make your information available to "everyone," it actually means 
"everyone, forever." Because even if you change your mind, it's too late (cid:173)
and although Facebook say they will remove it from your profile they will 
have no control abont how it is used outside of Facebook. 

Cluley :fi.uther states, "there's a real danger that people will go along with Facebook's 
recommendations without considering carefully the possible consequences."90 

84. Other industry experts anticipated the problems that would result from the changes in 

Facebook's privacy settings. In early July, TechCrunch, Jason Kincaid wrote: 

Facebook clearly wants its users to become more comfortable sharing their 
content across the web, because that's what needs to happen if the site is 
going to take Twitter head--on with real-time search capabilities 
Unfortunately that's far easier said than done for the social network, whlch 
has for years trumpeted its granular privacy settings as one of its greatest 
assets. 91 

Kincaid observed that "Face book sees its redesigned control panel as an opportunity to 
invite users to start shrugging off their privacy. So it's piggybacking the new 'Everyone' 
feature on top of the Transition Tool .. .''92

85. Following the changes in Facebook privacy settings, noted blogger Danny Sullivan 

wrote, "I came close to killing my Facebook account this week." He went on to say, "I 
was disturbed to discover things I previously had as options were no longer in my 
control." Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Land and an. expert in search engine 
design.93 concluded: 

I  don't have time for this. I don't have time to try and figure out the 
myriad of ways that Facebook may or may not want to use my 
information. That's why I almost shut down my entire account this week. 
It would be a hell of a lot easier than this mess.94 

86. Carleton College librarian Iris Jastram states that the privacy trade-off resulting from the 

Facebook changes is not "worth it." She writes, 

I'm already making concessions by making myself available to the 
students who want to frien~me there and by grudgingly admitting that I 
like the rolodex function it plays. But I feel zero motivation to give up 
more than I can help to Facebook and its third party developers. They can 
kindly leave me alone, please.95 

87. Chris Bourg, manager of the Information Center at Stanford University Libraries, notes 

that "[t]here are some concerns with the new default/recommended privacy settings, 
wlrich make your updates visible to Everyone, including search engines. "96 

88. Reuters columnist Felix Salmon learned ofFacebook's revised privacy settings when 

Facebook disclosed lris "friends" list to critics, who republished the personal information. 
Salmon apologized to his friends and denounced the Facebook "Everyone,. setting: 

I'm a semi-public figure, and although I might not be happy with this kind 
of cybersta.lking, I know I've put myself out there and that there will be 
consequences of that. But that decision of mine shouldn't have some kind

of transitive property which feeds through to my personal friends, and I 
don't want the list of their names to be publicly available to everyone.97 

89. In a blog post responding to the revisions, Marshall Kirkpatrick ofReadWriteWeb wrote, 
"the company says the move is all about helping users protect their privacy and connect 
with other people, but tbe new default option is to change from 'old settings' to becoming 
visible to 'everyone.' .•.. This is not what Facebookusers signed up for.  It's not about 
privacy at all, it's about increasing traffic and the visibility of activity on the site. "98 

90. Jared Newman of PC World details Facebook's privacy revisions.99 He is particularly 

critical oftbe "Everyone" setting; 

By default, Facebook suggests sharing everything on your profile to make 
it 'easier for friends to find, identify and learn about you.' n should read, 
'make it easier for anyone in the world to find, identify and learn about 
you.' A little creepier, sure, but this is part ofFacebook's never-ending 
struggle to be, essentially, more like Twitter. Thing is, a lot of people like 
Facebook because it isn't like Twitter. Don't mess with a good tbing.100 

91. Rob Pegoraro blogged on the Washington Post's "Faster Forward" that the Facebook 

changes were "more of a mess than I'd expected."  He criticized the revised "Everyone" 
privacy setting, stating the change "should never have happened. Both from a usability 
and aPR perspective, the correct move would have been to leave users' settings as they 
were,  especially for those who had already switched their options from the older 
defaults."101 

92. In another Washington Post story, Cecilia Kang warned users, "post with care.''102 

According to Kang: 

While Facebook users will be able to choose their privacy settings, tbe 
problem is that most people don't take the time to do so and may simply

stick with the defaults. Others may :find the process confusing and may not 
understand how to adjust those settings. Facebook said about one in five 
users currently adjusts privacy settings.103 

93. New York Times technology writer Brad Stone reported that these changes have not been 

welcomed by many users.104 One user wrote: 

It's certainly a violation of my privacy policy. My own 'personal' privacy 
policy specifically states that I will not share information about my friends 
with any potential weirdos, child molesters, homicidal maniacs, or anyone 
I generally don't like.105 

94. Stone invited readers'to comment on their understanding of the changes. Of the more 

than 50 responses received, most expressed confusion, concern, or anger. One user 
explained, 

I find the changes to be the exact opposite of what Face book claims them 
to be. Things that were once private for me, and for carefully selected 
Faceboo.k friends, are now open to everyone on the Internet. This is simply 
not what I signed up for. These are not the privacy settings I agreed to. It 
is a complete violation of privacy, not the other way around. 106 

95. Another Facebook user wrote, 

There are users likemyselfthatjoinedFacebookbecause we were able to 
connect with friends and family while maintalllln.g our privacy and now 
FB has taken that away. Im [sic] wondering where are the millions of 
users that told FB it would be a good idea to offer real~time search results 
of their FB content on Google. 1 07 

96. A Boston Globe editorial, "Facebook's privacy downgrade," observes that "Facebook's 
subtle nudges toward greater disclosure coincided with other disconcerting changes: The 
site is treating more infor.mation, such as a user's home city and photo, as  'publicly 
available information'  that the user cannot control. Over time, privacy changes can only

members keep more of their information private."108

site isn't necessarily what's good forusers." 109 

V.  Legal Analysis 

The FTC's SectionS Authority 

98. Facebook is engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices. 110 Such practices are 

prohibited by the FTC Act, and the Commission is empowered to enforce the Act's 
prohibitions.lll These powers are described in FTC Policy Statements on Deception tU 
and Unfaim.ess.113 

99. A trade practice is unfair if it "causes or is likely to cause substantial .injury to consumers 

which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by 
countervailing benefits to consumers or to 'competition."114 

100. 

The injury must be "substantial. " 1 15 Typically, this involves monetary harm, but 

may also include "unwarranted healtb and safetyrisks."116 Emotional hann and other 
"more subjective types of harm" generally do not make a practice unfair. 117 Secondly, the 
injury "must not be outweighed by an offsetting consumer or competitive benefit that the

sales practice also produces. ''118 Thus the FTC will not find a practice unfair "unless it is 
injurious in its net effects!'119 Finally, "the injury must be one which consumers could 
not reasonably have avoided. "120 This factor is an effort to ensure that consumer decision 
making still governs the market by limiting the FrC to act in situations where seller 
behavior ''unreasonably creates or takes advantage of an obstacle to tbe free exercise of 
consumer decisionmaking."UJ Sellers may not withhold from conswners important price 
or performance infonnation. engage in coercion, or unduly influence highly susceptt"ble 
classes of consumers. 122 

101. 

The FTC will also look at '<whether the conduct violates public policy as it has 

been established by statute, common law, industry practice, or otherwise."123 Public 
policy is used to "test the validity and strength of the evidence of consmner injury, or, 
les~ often, it may be cited for a dispositive legislative or judicial determination that such 
injury is present."t:24 

102. 

The FTC will make a finding of deception if there bas been a "representation, 

omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the 
circumstances, to the consumer's detriment " 125 

103. 

First, there must be a representation. omission. or practice that is likely to mislead 

the consumer.126 The relevant inquiry for this factor is not whether the act or practice 
actually misled the consumer, but rather whether it is likely to mislead.m Second, the act 
or practice must be considered from the perspective of a reasonable consumer. 128 "The 
test is whether the consumer's interpretation or reaction is reasonable."129 The FTC will 
look at the totality of the act or practice and ask questions such as "how clear is the 
representation? How conspicuous is any qualifying information? How important is the

the public with the product or service?"130 

104. 

Finally, the representation, omission, or practice must be material.191 Essentially, 

the information must be important to consumers. The re1evant question is whether 
consumers would have chosen another product if the deception had not occurred.132 
Express claims will be presumed material.l33 Materiality is presumed for claims and 
omissions involving "health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer 
would be concemed.''134 The harms of this social networking site's practices are within 
the scope of the FTC's authority to enforce Section 5 of the FTC Act and its purveyors 
should face FTC action for these violations. 

Mate~ Changes to Privacy Practices and 

Misrepresenbttions of Privacy Policies 

Constitute Consumer Harm 

105. 

FaceboQk's actions mjure users throughout the United States by invading their 
privacy; allowing for disclosure and use of information in ways and for purposes other 
than those consented to or relied upon by such users; causing them to believe falsely that 
they have full control over the use of their information; and undennining the ability of 
users to avail themselves of the privacy protections promised by the company. 

106. 

The FTC Act empowers and directs the FTC to investigate business practices, 
including data collection practices, that constitute consumer harm.135 The Commission 
realizes the importance of transparency and clarity in privacy policies. 'Without real 
transparency, consumers cannot make informed decisions about how to share their 
information. "136 

107. 

The FTC recently found that Sears Holding Management Corporations business 

practices violated the privacy of its customers.137 The conseut order arose from the 
company's use of software to collect and disclose users' online activity to third parties,

and a misleading privacy policy that did not ''adequately [inform consumers as to] the full 
extent of the information the software tracked."138 The order requires that the company 
fully, clearly, and prominently disclose the "types of data the software will monitor, 
record, or transmit.''139 Further, the company must disclose to consumers whether and 
.how this information will be used by third parties. 140 

108. 

The Commission has also obtained a consent order against an online company for 
changing its privacy policy in an unfair and deceptive manner. In 2004, the FTC charged 
Gateway Learning Cm:poration with making a material change to its privacy policy, 
allowing the company to share users' information with third parties, without first 
obtaining users' consent 141 This was the first enforcement action to "challenge deceptive 
and unfair practices in connection with a company's material change to its privacy 
policy.''142 Gateway Learning made representations on the site's privacy policy, stating 
that consumer information would not be sold, rented or loaned to .third parties.143 In 
:violation of these terms, the company began renting personal information provided by 
consumers, including gender, age and name, to third parties.144 Gateway then revised its 
privacy policy to provide for the renting of consumer information "from time to time," 
applying the policy retroactively.145 The settlement bars Gateway Learning from, among 
other things~ "misrepresent[ing] in any manner, expressly or by implication ... the 
manner in which Respondent will collect, use, or disclose personal infonnation."146 

109. 

Furthermore, the FTC has barred deceptive claims about privacy and security 

policies with respect to personally identifiable, or sensitive, infonnation.147 In 2008, the 
FTC issued an order prohibiting Life is Good, Inc. from ''misrepresent[ing] in any 
manner, expressly or by implication, the extent to which respondents maintain and 
protect the privacy, confidentiality, or integrity of any per$onal information collected

committed to maintaining our customers' privacy," when in fact, it did not have secure or 
adequate measures of protecting personal infonnation. 149 The Commission further 
ordered the company to establish comprehensive privacy protection measures in relation 
to its custome.rs' sensitive information. 150 

Facebook's Revisions to the Privacy Settings 

Constitute an Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practice 

110. 

Facebook represented that users .. may not wi!.Dt everyone in the world to have the 
information you share on Facebook," and that users "have extensive and precise controls 
available to choose who sees what among their network and friends, as well as tools 1:h.at 
give them the choice to make a limited set of information available to search engines and 
other outside entities. "151 

• 

111. 

Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings and associated policies in fact 
categorize as "publicly available information" users' names, profile photos, lists of 
friends, pages they are fans of: gender, geographic regions, and networks to which they 
belong.152 Those categories of user data are no longer subject to users' privacy settings. 

112. 

Facebookrepresented that its changes to its policy settings and associated policies 

regarding application developers permit users to "opt-out ofFacebook Platform and 
Facebook Connect altogether through [their] privacy settings,'' 153 and tells users, "you 
can control how you share information with those third-party applications and websites 
through your application settings"154 

113. 

Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings and associated policies regarding 
application developers in fact eliminate the universal one-click option for opting out of 
Facebook Platform and Facebook Connect, and replaces it with a less comprehensive

option that requires users to provide application developers with personal information 
that users could previously prevent application developers from accessing.155 

114. 

Facebook's representations regarding its changes to users' privacy settings and 
associated policies are misleading and fail to provide users clear and necessary privacy 
protections. 

115. 

Wide opposition by users, commentators, and advocates to the changes to 

Facebook's privacy settings and associated policies illustrate that the changes injure 
Facebook users and harm the public interest. 

116. 

Absent injunctive relief by the Commission, Facebook is likely to continue its 

unfair and deceptive business practices and harm the public interest 

117. 

Absent injunctive relief by the Commission, the privacy safeguards for consumers 

engaging in online commerce and new social network services will be significantly 
diminished. 

VI. Prayer for Investigation and Relief 

118. 

EPIC requests that the Commission investigate Facebook, enjoin its unfair and 
deceptive business practices, and require Facebook to protect the privacy of Facebook 
users.  Specifically~ EPIC requests tlle Commission to: 

Compel Facebook to restore its previous privacy settings allowing users to choose 
whether to publicly disclose personal information, including name, current city, 
and friends; 

Compel Facebook to restore its previous privacy setting allowing users to fully 
opt out of revealing information to third-party developers; 

Compel Facebook to make its data collection practices clearer and more 
comprehensible and to give Facebook users meaningful control over personal 
information provided by Facebook to advertisers and developers; and 

Provide such other relief as the Commission finds necessary and appropriate.

COMPLA1NT 

DOCKET NO. C. 

The Federal Trade Commission, having reason to believe that Facebook, Inc., a 

cozporation (''Respondenf') has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act (''FTC Act"), and it 
appearing to the Commission that this proceeding is .in the public interest, alleges: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Respondent Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"), is a privately-owned, Delaware cozporation 
with its principal office or place of business at 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, 
California 94304. 

The acts and practices of Respondent as alleged in this complaint have been. in or 
~cting commerce, as ''commerce" is defined in Section 4 of the FI'C Act. 

FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS PRACTICES 

Since at least 2004, Facebook has operated www.facebook.com, a social networking 
website.  Users of the site create online profiles, which contain content about them such 
as their name, interest groups they join, the names of other users who are their "friends'' 
on the site, photos albums and videos they upload, and messages and comments they post 
or receive from their friends.  Users also may add content to  other users' profiles by 
sharing photos, sending messages, or posting comments.  As of August 2011, Face book 
had approximately 750 million users. 

4. 

Since approximately May 2007, Facebookhas operated the Facebook Platform 
(''Platform"), a set of tools and programming interfaces that enables third parties to 

1 

'I 
I

develop, run. and operate software applications, such as games, that users can interact 
with online ( .. Platform Applications"). 

5. 

Facebook obtains revenue by placing third-party advertisements on its site and by selling 
Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that it offers on its website and through retail 
outlets.  The company also has obtained revenue from fees paid by applicants for its 
Verified Apps program, described below in Paragraphs 4347.  In 2009, the company had 
revenues of approximately $777.2 million. 

FACEBOOK'S COLLECTION AND STORAGE OF USER INFORMATION 

6. 

Facebook has collected extensive "profile information" about its users, including, but not 
limited to: 

a. 

mandatory information that a user must submit to register with the site, including 
Name, Gender, Email Address, and Birthday; 

b. 

optional information that a user may submit, such as: 

1. 
ii. 
iii. 
iv. 

v. 

vi. 
vii. 

Profile Picture; 
Hometown; 
Interested in (i.e., whether a user is interested in men or women); 
Looking for (i.e., whether a user is looking for friendship, dating, a 
relationship, or networking); 
Relationships (e.g., marital or other relationship status and the names of 
family members); 
Political and Religious Views; 
Likes and Interests (e.g., activities, interests, music, books, or movies that 
a user likes); and 

viii.  Education and Work (e.g., the name of a user's high school, college, 

graduate school, and employer); 

and 

c. 

other information that is based on a user's activities on the site over time, such as: 

i. 

n. 

ru. 

a Friend List (i.e., a list of users with whom a user has become "Friends., 
on the site); 
Pages (e.g., any web page on Facebook's web site, belonging to an 
organization, brand, interest group, celebrity, or other.entity, that a user 
has clicked an online button to "fan" or ''like"); 
Photos and Videos, including any that a user has uploaded or been "tagged 
in" (i.e., identified by a user such that his or her name is displayed when a 
user ''hovers" over the likeness); and 

2 

iv. 

messages that a user posts and comments made in response to other users' 
content 

7. 

8. 

9. 

Each user's profile information becomes part of the user's online profile and can be 
accessible to others, as descnbed below. 

Facebook bas stored users' profile information on a computer network that it controls.  It 
has assigned to each user a User Identification Number ("User ID''), a persistent, unique 
number that Platform Applications and others can use to obtain certain profile 
information from Facebook. 

Facebook has designed its Platform such that Platform Applications can access user 
profile information in two main instances.  First, Platform Applications that a user 
authorizes can access the user's profile information.  Second, if a user's "Friend" 
authorizes a Platform Application, that application can access certain of the user's profile 
information, even if the user has not authorized that Application.  For example, if a user 
authorizes a Platform Application that provides reminders about Friends' birthdays, that 
application could access, among other things, the birthdays of the user's Friends, even if 
these Friends never authorized the application.

Since at least November 2009, Facebook bas, in many instances, provjded its users with a 
"Central Privacy Page," the same or similar to the one depicted below.  Among other 
things, this page bas contained a ''Profile" link, with accompanying tex't that bas stated

13. 

Although the precise language has changed over time, Facebook's Central Privacy Page 
and Profile Privacy Page hav-e, in many instances, stated that the Profile Privacy Settings 
allow users to "control who can see" their profile information, by specifying who can 
access it, e.g., "Only Friends" or "Friends ofFriends."  (See Central Privacy Page and 
Profile Privacy Page screenshots, Exhibit A). 

Similarly, although the precise interface has changed over time, Facebook's Profile 
Privacy Settings have continued to specify that users can restrict access to their profile 
information to the audience the user selects, e.g., "Only Friends," "Friends ofFriends." 
(See Profile Privacy Page screenshots, Exln"bits A, B).  In many instances, a user's Profile 
Privacy Settings have been accompanied by a lock icon.  Jd. 

14.  None of the pages descnbed in Paragraphs 10-13 have disclosed that a user's choice to 

restrict profile information to "Only Friends" or "Friends of Friends" would be 
ineffective as to certain third parties.  Despite tlris fact, in many instances, Facebook has 
made profile information that a user chose to restrict to "Only Friends'' or "Friends of 
Friends" accesSible to any Platform Applications that the user's Friends have used 
(hereinafter ''Friends' Apps'').  Information shared with such Friends' Apps bas included, 
among other things, a user's birthday, hometown, activities, interests, status updates, 
marital status, education (e.g., schools attended), place of employment, photos, and 
videos. 

15. 

16. 

17. 

18. 

Facebook's Central Privacy Page and Profile Privacy Page have included links to 
"Applications," "Apps," or "Applications and Websites'' that, when clicked, have taken 
users to a page containing ''Friends' App Settings," which would allow users to restrict 
the information that their Friends' Apps could access. 

However, in many instances, the links to "Applications," "Apps," or "Applications and 
Websites" have failed to disclose that a user's choices made through Profile Privacy 
Settings have been ineffecti~e against Friends' Apps.  For example, the language 
alongside the Applications link, depicted in Paragraph 10, has stated, "[ c ]ontrol what 
information is available to applications you use on Facebook."  (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
users who did not themselves use applications would have bad no reason to click on this 
link, and would have concluded that their choices to restrict profile information through 
their Profile Privacy Settings were complete and effective. 

Coant1 

As described in Paragraphs 10-13, Facebookhas represented, expressly or by 
implication, that, through their Profile Privacy Settings, users can restrict access to then 
profile information to specific groups, such as "Only Friends" or ''Friends of Friends." 

In truth and in fact, in many instances, users could not restrict access to their profile 
information to specific groups, such as "Only Friends" or "Friends of Friends" through 
their Profile Privacy Settings.  Instead, such information could be accessed by Platform 

6 

Applications that their Friends used.  Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 
17 constitutes a false or misleading representation. 

FACEBOOK'S UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE DECEMBER 2009 PRIVACY CHANGES 

(Count 2 and Count 3) 

19. 

20. 

21. 

22. 

On approximately November 19, 2009, Facebook changed its privacy policy to designate 
certain user information as "publicly available" ("P AI'').  On approximately December 8, 
2009, Facebook began implementing the changes refere.nced in its new policy ("the 
December Privacy Changes'') to make public in new ways certain information that users 
previously had provided. 

Before December 8, 2009, users could, and did, use their Friends' App Settings to restrict 
Platform Applications' access to their PAl.  For example, as of November 2009, 
approximately 586,241 users had used these settings to "block" Platform Applications 
that their Friends used from accessing any of their profile information, including their 
Name, Profile Picture, Gender, Friend List, Pages, and Networks.  Following the 
December Privacy Changes, Facebook users no longer could restrict access to their PAl 
through these Friends' App Settings, and all prior user choices to do so were overridden. 

Before December 8. 2009, users could, and did, use their Profile Privacy Settings to limit 
access to their Friend List.  Following the December Privacy Changes, Facebook users 
could no longer restrict access to their Friend List through their Profile Privacy Settings, 
and all prior user choices to do so were overridden, making a user's Friend List 
accessible to other users.  Although Facebook reinstated these settings shortly thereafter, 
they were not restored to the Profile Privacy Settings and instead were effectively hid.den. 

Before December 8, 2009, users could, and did, use their Search Privacy Settings 
(available through the "Search" link on the Privacy Settings Page depicted in Paragraph 
11) to restrict access to their Profile Picture and Pages from other Facebook users who 
fonnd them by searching for them on F ttcebook.  For example, S!.S of June 2009, 
approximately 2.5 million users who had set their Search Privacy Settings to 
''Everyone/' still hid their Profile Picture.  Following the December Privacy cpanges, 
Facebook users could no longer restrict the visibility of their Profile Picture and Pages 
through these settings, and all prior user choices to do so were overridden. 

23. 

To implement the December Privacy Changes, Facebook.required each user to click 
through a multi-page notice, known as the Privacy Wizard, which was composed of: 

a. 

an introductory page, which announced: 

We're making some changes to give you more control of your information 
and help you stay connected.  We've simplified the Privacy page and 
added the ability to set privacy on everything you share, from status 
updates to photos. 

7 

i . 

At the same time, we're helping everyone find and connect with each 
other by keeping some information -like your name and current city(cid:173)
publicly available.  The next step will guide you through choosing your 
privacy settings. 

b. 

privacy update pages, which required each users to choose, via a series of radio 
buttons, between new privacy settings that Facebook "recommended•' and the 
user's "Old Settings," for ten types of profile information(e.g., Photos and 
Videos ofMe, Birthday, Family and Relationships, etc.), and which stated: 

Facebook's new, simplified privacy settings give you more control over 
the information you share.  We'verecommended settings below, but you 
can choose to apply your old settings to any of the fields. 

and 

c. 

a confirmation page, which su.mmarized the user's updated Privacy Settings. 

(See Privacy Wizard screenshots, Exhibit C). 

24. 

25. 

26. 

The Privacy Wizard did not disclose adequately that users no longer could restri,ct access 
to their newly-designated P AI via their Profile Privacy Settings, Friends' App Settings, 
or Search Privacy Settings, or that their existing choices to restrict access to such 
information via these settings would be overridden.  For example, the Wizard did not 
disclose that a user's existing choice to share his or her Friend List with "Only Friends" 
would be overridden, and that this information would be made accessible to the public. 

The information that Facebook failed to disclose as described in Paragraph 24 was 
material to Facebook users. 

Face book's designation of P AI caused harm to users, including, but not limited to, threats 
to their health and safety, and unauthorized revelation of their affiliations.  Among other 
things: 

a. 

b. 

certain users were subject to the risk of unwelcome contacts from persons who 
may have been able to infer their locale, based on the locales of their Friends 
(e.g., their Friends' Current City information) and of the organizations reflected 
in their Pages; 

each user's Pages became visible to anyone who viewed the user's profile, 
thereby exposing potentially controversial political views or other sensitive 
information to third parties -such as prospective employers, government 
organizations, or business competitors - who sought to obtain personal 
information about the user; 

8 

c. 

each user's Friend List became visible to anyone who viewed the user's profile, 
thereby exposing potentially sensitive affiliations, that could, in tum, reveal a 
user's political views, sexual orientation, or business relationships, to third parties 
- such as prospective employers, government organizations, or business 
competitors -who sought to obtain personal information about the user, and 

each user's Profile Photo became visible to anyone who viewed the user's profile, 
thereby revealing potentially embarrassing or political images to third parties 
whose access users previously had restricted. 

Count2 

As described in Paragraph 23, Facebook has represented, expressly, or by implication, 
that its December Privacy Changes provided users with "more control" over their 
information, including by allowing them to preserve their ''Old Settings," to protect the 
privacy of their profile information. 

As described in Paragraph 24-26, Faceboolc failed to disclose, or failed to disclose 
adequately, that, following the December Privacy Changes, users could no longer restrict 
access to their Name, Profile Picture, Gender, Friend List, Pages, or Networks by using 
privacy settings previously available to them.  Facebook also failed  to disclose, or failed 
to disclose adequately, that the December Privacy Changes overrode existing user 
privacy settings that restricted access to a user's Name, Profile Picture, Gender, Frie;nd 
List, Pages, or Networks.  These facts would be material to consumers.  Therefore, 
Facebook's failure to adequately disclose these facts, in light of the representation made, 
constitutes a deceptive act or practice. 

Count3 

As descnbed in Paragraphs 19-26, by designating certain user profile information 
publicly available that previously had been subject to privacy settings, Facebook 
materially changed its promises that users could keep such information private. 
Facebook retroactively applied these changes to personal information that it bad 
previously collected from users, without their informed consent, in_a manner that has 
caused or has been likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, was not outweighed 
by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition, and was not reasonably 
avoidable by consumers.  This practice constitutes 3D unfair act or practice. 

27. 

28.

SCOPE OF PLATFORM APPLICATIONS' ACCESS TO FACEBOOK USERS' 

INFORMATION 

(Count4) 

30. 

Facebook has disseminated or caused to be disseminated numerous statements to users 
stating that Platform Applications they use will access only the profile information these 
applications need to operate, including, but not limited to: 

a. 

the following statement, which appeared within a dialog box that each user must 
click through before using a Platform Application for the first time: 

Allowing [name of Application] access will let it pull your profile 
information, photos, your friends' info, and other content that it requires 
to work 

(Authorization Dialog box, Exhibit D); and 

b. 

the following additional statements on www .facebook.com: 

i. 

Applications you use will access your Facebook information in order for 
them to work. 

(Facebook Privacy Settings: What You Share, Ex.hl'bit E); and 

ii.  When you authorize an application, it will be able to access any 

information associated with your account that it requires to work. 

(Facebook Privacy Settings: How Applications Interact With Your Information, 
Exhibit F). 

31. 

Contrary to the statements set forth in Paragraph 30, in many instances, a Platform 
Application could access profile .information that was unrelated to the Application's 
purpose or unnecessary to its operation.  For example; a Platform Application with a 
narrow purpose, such as a quiz regarding a television show, in many instances could 
access a user's Relationship Status, as well as the URL for every photo and video that the 
user had uploaded to Facebook's web site, despite the lack of relevance of this 
information to the Application. 

Count4 

32. 

As set forth in Paragraph 30, Facebook has represented, expressly or by implication, that 
it has provided each Platform Application access only to such user profile information as 
the Application has needed to operate. 

10 

33. 

34. 

3 5. 

In truth and in fact, as descnbed in Paragraph 31, from approximately May 2007 until 
July 2010, in many instances, Facebook has provided Platform Applications unrestricted 
access to user profile information that such Applications have not needed to operate. 
Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 32 constitutes a false or misleading 
representation. 

FACEBOOK'S DISCLOSURE OF USER INFORMATION TO ADVERTISERS 

(CountS) 

Facebook has displayed advertisements ("ads") from third-parties ("Platform 
Advertisers") on its web site. 

Facebook has al!owed Platform Advertisers to target their ads ("Platform Ads") by 
requesting that Faceb"ook display them ~o users whose profile information reflects certain 
"targeted traits," including, but not limited to: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

e.

1. 

location (e.g.,  city or state), 

age,

"Interested in" responses (i.e., as descnbed in Paragraph 6(b ), whether a user is 
interested in men or women), 

Relationship Status, 

LDces and Interests, 

Education (e.g., level of education, current enrollment in high school or college~ 
affiliation wlth a particular college, and choice of major in college), and 

name of employer. 

'36. 

Facebookbas disseminated or caused to be disseminated numerous statements that it 
does not share information about its users with advertisers, including: 

a. 

Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an 
individual to third parties.  We do this for pmposes such as ... personalizing 
advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you Face book.  We believe 
this benefits you.  You can know more about the world around you and, where 
there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you.  For 
example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an 

11 

advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town.  But we 
don't tell the movie company who you are. 

(Facebook Privacy Policy, November 26, 2008, Exhibit G). 

b. 

We don't share information with advertisers without your consent ... We allow 
advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements 
and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attnbutes we have 
collected (including information you may have decided not to show other users, 
such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to 
select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.  For examp1e, we might 
ll.Se your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not 
tell the soccer equipment company who you are ... Even though we do not share 
your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or 
otherwise interact with an advertisement, there is a possibility that the advertiser 
may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they 
selected.. 

(Facebook Privacy Policy, November 19, 2009, Exhibit H). 

c. 

d. 

We do not give your content to advertisers.  (Facebook Statement of Rights and 
Responsibilities, May 1, 2009, Exhibit I). 

Still others asked to be opted-out of having their information shared with 
advertisers. This reflects a common misconception about advertising on 
Facebook.  We don't share your infonnation with advertisers unless you tell us to 
([e.g.,]  to get a sample, hear more, or enter a contest).  Any assertion to the 
contrary is false.  Period .. . we never provide the advertiser any names or other 
information about the people who are shown, or even who click on, the ads. 

(Facebook Blog, http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php, ''Responding to Your Feedback," 
Barry Schnitt, AprilS, 2010, Exlnbit J). 

e. 

We never share your personal information with advertisers.  We never sell your 
personal information to anyone.  These protections are yours no matter what 
privacy settings you use; they apply equally to people who share openly with 
everyone and to people who share with only select friends. 

The only information we provide to advertisers is aggregate and anonymous data, 
so they can know bow many people viewed their ad and general categories of 
information about them.  Ultimately, this helps advertisers better understand how 
well their ads work so they can show better ads. 

(Facebook Blog, http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php, "The Role of Advertising on 
Facebook," Sheryl Sandberg, July 6, 2010,.ExhibitK).

37. 

Contrary to the statements set forth in Paragraph 36(a)-{d), in many instances, Facebook 
has shared information about users with Platform Advertisers by identifying to them the 
users who clicked on their ads and to whom those ads were targeted.  Specifically, from 
at least September 2008 until May 26, 2010, Pacebook designed and operated its web site 
such that, in many instances, the User ID for a user who clicked on a Platform Ad was 
shared with the Platform Advertiser. 

38. 

As a result of the conduct descnbed in Paragraph 3 7, Platform Advertisers potentially 
could take steps to get detailed information about individual users.  For example, a 
Platfonn Advertiser could use the User ID to: 

a. 

access the user's profile page on www.facebook.com, to obtain his or her real 
name, and, after December 8, 2009, other P AI which has included a user's Profile 
Picture, Gender, Current City, Friend List, Pages, and Networks; 

b. 

combine the user's real name with: 

l. 

ii. 

any targeted traits used for the ad the user clicked (e.g., if the ad targeted 
23-year-old men who were "Interested In" men and "liked" a prescription 
drug, the advertiser could ascribe these traits to a specific user); and 

information about the user's visit to the advertiser's website, including: 
the time and date of the visit, the pages viewed, and time spent viewing 
the ad (collectively, "browsing information"); and 

c. 

over time, combine the information described in subparts (a)- (b) with targeting 
traits related to additional ads or other information about the user's browsing 
activities across the web. 

39. 

In addition, contrary to the statements set forth in Paragraph 36, Facebookhas shared 
information about users with third parties that advertise on certain Platform Application 
web sites ("Application Advertisers"), by identifying to them the specmc users who 
visited these applications.  Specillcally, at various times relevant to this Complaint, when 
a user visited certain Platform Applications, Faoebook disclosed the user's User ID, in 
plain text, to any Application Advertiser that displayed an ad on the application's web 
page. 

40. 

As a result of the conduct described in Paragraph 39, Application Advertisers potentially 
could take steps to get detailed information, similar to those steps described in Paragraph 
38(a), (b )(ii), and (c), regarding the user and his or her activities on any Platform 
Application web site where the advertiser displayed an ad

42. 

As set forth in Paragraph 36, Facebook has represented, expressly or by implication, that 
Facebook does not provide advertisers with information about its users. 

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraphs 37-40, Facebookhas provided advertisers 
with information about its users.  Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 41 
constitutes a false or misleading representation. 

FACEBOOK'S DECEPTIVE VERIFIED APPS PROGRAM 

(Count 6) 

43. 

From approximately May 2009un.til December 2009, Facebook operated a VerifiedApps 
program, through which it designated certain Platform Applications as "Facebook 
Verified Apps" ("Verified Apps"). 

44. 

Facebook provided each Verified App with preferential treatment compared to other 
Platform Applications, including, but not limited to: 

a. 

a Verified Apps badge, the same or similar to the badge depicted below, for 
display on the application's profile page on www .facebook.com.; and 

b. 

a green check mark alongside the Platform Applicatio.n's name, and higher 
ranking among search results, on www.facebook.com filld within F acebook's 
Application Directory. 

45. 

46. 

To apply for the VerifiedApps badge, a Platform Application developer paid Facebook a 
fee of$375, or $175 for a student or nonprofit organization.  Facebook awarded the 
badge to approximately 254 Platform Applications. 

Facebook has disseminated or caused to be disseminated statements to consumers 
conveying that it has taken steps to verify the security ofV erified Apps, compared to the 
security of other Platform Applications, including: 

a. 

the Verified Apps badge, described in Paragraph 44(a); 

14 

b. 

c. 

the Verified .Apps green check mark, descnl>ed in Paragraph 44(b ); and 

the following statements on its website: 

i. 

Application Verification Facebook is introducing the Application 
Verification program which is designed to offer e:rtra assurances to 
help users identify applications they can trust - applications that are 
secure, respectful and transparent, and have demonstrated 
commitment to  compliance with Platform policies. 

(Press Release, "Facebook Expands Power ofPlatform Across the Web and 
Around the World,'~ July 23,2008, ExllloitL (latter emphasis added)); and 

u. 

What are Verified Applications? 

Verified applications have passed a detailed Facebook review to confirm 
that the user experience they provide complies with Facebook policies. 
Verified Applications have committed to be transparent about how they 
work and will respect you and your friends when they send 
communication on your behalf. 

What is the green check mark next to some applications? 

Applications that choose to participate in Facebook's Application 
Verification Program receive a green check mark when they pass 
Facebook's detailed review process.  The review process is designed to 
ensure that the application complies with Facebook policies.  In 
addition, Verified applications have committed to be transparent about 
bow they work and will respect you and your friends when they send 
communication on your behalf. 

4 7. 

48. 

(Facebook Help Center F AQ, Exhibit M (emphases added)). 

Contrary to the statements set forth in Paragraph 46, before it awarded the Verified Apps 
badge, Facebook took no steps to verify either the security of a Verified Application's 
website or the security the Application provided for the user information it collected, 
beyond such steps as it may have taken regarding any other Platform Application. 

Count6 

As set forth in Paragraph 46, Facebook has represented, expressly or by implication, that 
Face book bas permitted a Platform Application to display its Verified Apps badge when 
Facebook's review of the security of such Applications bas exceeded its review of the 
security of other Platform Applications. 

15 

49. 

In truth and in fact, as descnoed in. Paragraph 47, in many instances Facebookhas 
pe.rmltted a Platform Application to display its Verified Apps badge when its review of 
the application's security has not exceeded its review of other Platform Applications. 
Therefore, the representation set forth in. Paragraph 48 constitutes a false or misleading 
representation. 

FACEBOOK'S DISCLOSURE OF USER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS 

(Count1) 

50. 

.  As descnoed above, Facebookhas collected and stored vast quantities of photos and 

videos that its users upload, including, but not limited to: at least one such photo from 
approximately ninety-nine percent of its users, and more than 100 million photos and 
415,000 videos from its users, collectively, every day. 

51. 

52. 

Facebook has stored users' photos and videos such that each one is assigned a Content 
URL- a uniform resource locator that specifies its location on Facebook' s servers. 
Facebook users and Platform Applications can obtain the Content URL for any photo or 
video that theyview onFacebook's web site by, for example, right-clicking on it.  !fa 
user or Application further disseminates this URL, Facebook will "serve" the user's 
photo or video to anyone wh.o clicks on the URL. 

Facebook has disseminated or caused to be disseminated statements communicating that 
a user can restrict access to his or her profile information - including, but not limited to, 
photos and videos that a user uploads- by deleting or deactivating his or her user 
account  Such statements include: 

a. 

Deactivating or deleting your account.  If you want to stop using your account 
you may deactivate it or delete it When you deactivate an account, no user will 
be able to see it, but it will not be deleted ... When you delete an account, it is 
pennanently deleted from Pacebook. 

*** 
Backup copies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies 
for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others; 

(Facebook Privacy Policy, November 19,2009, Exhibit H); 

b. 

To deactivate your account, navigate to the "Settings" tab on the Account Settings 
page.  Deactivation will remove your profile and content associated with your 
account from Facebook.  In addition, users will not be able to search for you or 
view any of your information.

16 

IT you deactivate your account, your profile and all information associated with it 
are immediately made inaccessible to other Facebook users.

IT you deactivate your account from the "Deactivate Account" section on the 
Account page, your profile and all information associated with it are immediately 
made inaccessible to other Facebook users. 

(FacebookHelp Center FAQ, Exhlbit P). 

53. 

Contrary to the statements set forth in Paragraph 52, Facebookhas continued to display 
users • photos and videos to anyone who accesses Facebook' s Content URLs for them, 
even after such users have deleted or deactivated their accounts. 

54. 

55. 

56. 

Count? 

As set forth in Paragraph 52, Facebook has represented, expressly or by implication, that 
after a user has deleted or deactivated his or her account, Facebook does not provide third 
parties with access to his or her profile information, including any photos or videos that 
the user bas uploaded. 

In truth and in fact, as descnbed in Paragraph 53, in many instances, Facebook has 
provided third parties with access to a user's profile infonnation- specifically photos or 
videos that a user has uploaded- even after the user has deleted or deactivated his or her 
account.  Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 54 constitutes a false or 
misleading representation. 

U.S.-EU SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORK 

(Count 8) 

The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework provides a method for U.S. companies to t:rapsfer 
personal data outside of the European Union ("EU") that is consistent with the 
requirements of the European Union Data Protection Directive ("Directive").  The 
Directive sets forth EU requirements for privacy and the protection of personal data. 
Among other things, it requires EU Member States to implement legislation that prohibits 
the transfer of personal data outside the EU, with exceptions, unless the European 
Commission ("EC") has made a determination that the recipient jurisdiction's laws 
ensure the protection of such personal data.  This determination is commonly referred to 
as meeting the EU's "adequacy" standard. 

57. 

To satisfy the EU's adequacy standard for certain commercial transfers, the U.S. 
Department of Commerce ("Commerce") and the EC negotiated the U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework, which went into effect in 2000.  The Safe Harbor is a voluntary 

17 

framework that allows U.S. compairies to transfer personal data lawfully from the EU to 
the U.S.  To join the Safe Harbor, a company must self:..certify to Commerce that it 
complies with se-ven principles and related requirements that have been deemed to meet 
the EU' s adequacy standard. 

58. 

The Safe Harbor privacy principles, issued by Commerce on July 21, 2000, include the 
following: 

NOTICE:  An organization must inform individuals abont the pwposes for which 
it collects and uses infonnation about them, how to contact the organization with any 
inquiries  or  complaints,  the  types  of third  parties  to  which  it  discloses  the 
information,  and the  choices  and  means  the organization  offers  individuals  for 
limiting its use and disclosure. This notice must be provided in clear and conspicuous 
language when individuals are first asked  to provide personal information to the 
organization  or as  soon thereafter as  is  practicable,  but in any  event  before the 
organization uses such information for a purpose other than that for which it was 
originally collected or processed by the transferring organization or discloses it for 
the first time to a third party. 

CHOICE: An organization must offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt 
out) whether their personalinfonnation is (a) to be disclosed to a third party or (b) 
to be used for a purpose that is incompatible with the pmpose(s) for which it was 
originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  Individuals must 
be  provided  with  clear  and  conspicuous,  readily  available,  and  affordable 
mechanisms to exercise choice. 

59. 

60. 

From at least May 10,2007, until the present, Facebookhas maintained a cuuent self(cid:173)
certification to Commerce and bas appeared on the list of Safe Harbor companies on the 
Commerce website.  Pursuant to its self-certi.fication, Facebookhas transferred data 
collected from its users in the EU to the U.S. for processing. 

From approx.imately May 2007 until the present, Facebook has stated in its Privacy 
Policy that it participates in, adheres to, and/or complies with "the EU Safe Harbor 
Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce." (See 
Facebook Privacy Policy, November 26, 2008, Exhibit G; Facebook Privacy Policy, 
November 19, 2009, Exhibit H; Facebook Privacy Policy, December 9, 2009, Exhibit Q; 
F acebook Privacy Policy, April22, 2010, Eilibit R; Facebook Privacy Policy, December 
22,2010, Exluoit S).  Similarly, from approximately November 19, 2009 until the 
present, Facebook has stated on the Commerce website that it "adheres to the U.S.  Safe 
Harbor Framework developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European 
Union."

In truth and in fact, as described in Paragraphs 10-42 and 50-55, in many instances, 
Facebook has not adhered to the U.S. Safe Harbor Privacy Principles ofNotice and 
Choice.  Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 61  constitutes a deceptive

DECISION AND ORDER 

The Federal Trade Commission, having initiated an investigation of certain acts and 
practices of the Respondent named in the caption hereof: and the Respondent having been 
furnished thereafter with a copy of a draft Complaint that the Bureau of Consumer Protection 
proposed to present to the Commission for its consideration and which, if issued, would charge 
the Respondent with violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45 et seq.; 

The Respondent and counsel for the Commission having thereafter executed an 

Agreement Containing Consent Order ("Consent Agreement"), an admission by the Respondent 
of all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the aforesaid draft Complaint, a statement that the 
signing of said Consent Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an 
admission by the Respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in such Complaint, or that 
the facts as alleged in such Complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true, and waivers and 
other provisions as required by the Commissjon•s Rules; and 

The Commission having thereafter considered the matter and having determined that i1 
has reason to believe thatthe Respondent has violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and 
that a Complaint should issue stating its charges in that respect, and having thereupon accepted 
the executed Consent Agreement and placed such Consent Agreement on the public record for a 
period of thirty (30) days for the receipt and consideration of public comments, and having 
carefully considered the comments filed by interested persons, now in further conformity with

MEMORANDUM OPINION 

RICHARD D. BENNETT, District Judge. 

'*1  Tbe  Federal  Trade  Commission  ("FTC")  brought 
this  case  under  sections  5(a)  and  13(b)  of the  Federal 
Trade  Commission Act  ("FTC  Act"),  15  U.S.C.  §§  45(a) 
and  53(b ),  against  a  group  of  corporate  entities  and 
individuals  for  alleged  deceptive  conduct  in  coz:nection 
with  the  sale  of software.  Specifically,  the  FTC  alleged 
that two companies, Defendants Innovative Marketing, Inc. 
(''Innnvative Marketing") and ByteHosting Internet Services, 
LLC ("ByteHosting") operated as a  common enterprise (the 
"IMI  Enterprise"  or  "Enterprise')  to  conduct  a  massive 
"scareware" 1  scheme that marketed a variety of computer 
security software via deceptive advertising. The FTC alleged 
that  several  of  the  companies'  officers  and  directors, 
namely, Sam Jain ("Jain"), Daniel Sundin ("Sundin"), Marc 
D'Souza ("D'Souza"), Kristy Ross ("Ross"), and James Reno 
("Reno"), directed or participated in the 1MI Enterprise. 

The FTC filed the present action on December 2, 2008. After 
a hearing was held on December 12, 2008, this Court entered 
a  Preliminary Injunction  that served to,  inter alia,  prohibit 

Defendants from  continuing the alleged  deceptive business 
activities, freeze Defendants' assets, and compel Defendants 
to tum over certain business records to the FTC. 

Of the  original  eight  defendants,  four  have  settled  with 
the FTC,  and three are in default  and  have had judgments 
entered against them for failure  to  appear and participate in 
this  litigation. Defendant Kristy Ross is the only remaining 
defendant, and the sole remaining motion, the FTC's Motion 
for  SUIIIIIl8{)' Judgment,  pertains  to her alone.  On May  9, 
2012, this  Court  held a  bearin.g  on  that  motion  pursuant 
to  Local Rule  105.6  (D.Md.2011). 2  For the  reasons  that 
follow, the Federal Trade Commission's Motion for Summary 
Judgment (ECF No. 186) Is DENIED, and a bench trial has 
been scheduled for September 10, 2012. 

BACKGROUND 

The  background  facts  of this  case  were  fully  set  forth 
in this  Court's  previous Memorandum  Opinion  entered on 
September  16,  2009.  See  Federal  Trade  Commission  v. 
lnn(Jllative Marketing, Inc.,  654 F.Supp.2d 378 (D.Md.2009) 
(ECF Nos.  138  &  139). That background is repeated  here, 
in part, so as  to provide context for the pending motion for 
summary judgment. 

The FTC's Complaint sets forth a host of factual allegations, 
general  and  specific,  concerning  misconduct  committed 
by  the  corporate  defendants,  Innovative  Marketing,  and 
Bytebosting,  and  the  individual  defendants,  Reno,  Jain, 
Sundin,  Ross,  and  Marc  and  Maurice  D'Souza.  The 
Complaint alleges  that since at  least 2003,  the Defendants 
conspired  to sell  computer  security  software  by means  of 
deceptive Internet advertising. More specifically, Defendants 
allegedly  issued  exploitive  advertisements  that redirected 
consumers 10 sites that falsely  claimed that the consumers' 
computers  had  been  scanned  and  that  certain  viruses, 
pornographic  pictures,  or  compromised  files  had  been 
discovered. The consumers  were then directed  to purchase 
computer security software in order to purge their computers 
1:lf the suspect files  purportedly detected by the Defendants' 
fake scans. 

*2  The  Complaint also alleges that since 2004  or earlier, 
Defendants had placed misleading advertisements for their 
software products with major Internet advertising networks, 
which  serve  as  brokers  that  distribute  advertisements  to 
their  website partners. The advertising networks contracted

2012-2 Trade Cases P 78,075 

with their partners to display the Defendants' advertisements 
across  the  Internet.  After  the  advertising  networks,  such 
as  MyGeek,  began  to  receive  complaints,  they  stopped 
accepting  Defendants1  advertisements.  At  this  point,  in 
2007,  Defendants  allegedly  began  creating  a  number  of 
sham  Internet  advertising  agencies  that  duped  advertising 
networks  and  commercial  websites  into  accepting  their 
misleading  advertisements.  Toward  this  end,  Defendants 
falsely  represented  that  they  were  authorized  to  place 
advertisements, and they used sophisticated program coding 
that concealed the  exploitative nature  of the  ads  from the 
advertising networks to  gain  their approval for distribution. 
Once distributed and placed upon popular Internet sites, the 
exploitative content of the  ads was revealed to many of the 
consumers, who were thereupon redirected to the Defendants' 
websites  that operated 1b.e  bogus  scans.  The  FTC  alleges 
that this scheme resulted in substantial consumer injury, and 
that more than one million  consumers  were  deceived  into 
purchasing the Defendants' software products. 

Defendant  Kristy  Ross  does  not  directly  contradict  these 
assertions  made  by  the  FTC  and  does  not  argue  that 
Innovative Marketing or the other named defendants did not 
violate the FTC Act through unfair and deceptive advertising 
and marketing. Instead, her opposition to the FTC's motion 
centers on her role in the company-specifically, she argues 
that she was merely an employee and not a "control person" 
at the company, that she did not have the requisite knowledge 
of the misconduct at issue,  and as a result,  cannot be held 
individually liable under the Act. In this regard, the specific 
allegations  concerning Ross'  control and  knowledge of  the 
company's conduct will be discussed in the Analysis section 
infra.

In undertaking  this  inquiry,  this  Court  must  consider  the 
facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable 
to  the  nonmoving party.  Ricci v.  DeStefano,  557  U.S.  557, 
129 S.Ct. 2658, 2677, 174 L.Ed.2d 490 (U.S.2009) (quoting 
Scott  v.  Han·is,  550  U.S.  372,  380,  12'7  S.Ct.  1769,  167 
L.Ed.2d 686 (2007)). However,  this  Court must also  abide 
by its affinnative obligation to prevent factually unsupported 
claims and defenses from going to trial. Drewitt v. Pratt,  999 
F.2d 774,  77&-79  (4th Cir.l993). If the evidence presented 
by  the  nonmoving  party  is  merely  colorable,  or  is  not 
significantly probative, summary judgment must be granted. 
Anderson,  471  U.S.  at 249-50.  On the other band,  a party 
opposing  summary judgment must  ''do  more  than simply 
show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material 
facts."  Matsushita Elec. Indus.  Co. v.  Zenith Radio  Corp., 
475 U.S.  574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538  (1986); 
see also  In re Apex Express Corp. , 190 F.3d 624,  633  (4th 
Cir.1999). This Court has previously explained that a ''party 
cannot create a genuine dispute of material fact through mere 
speculation or compilation of inferences."  Shin  v.  Shalala, 
166 F.Supp.2d 373, 375 (D.Md.2001) (citations omitted). 

..WALYSIS 

*3  The FTC has brought the present action under sections 
5(a)  and  13  of the FTC Act.  Section  5(a)  of the  Act,  15 
U.S.C. § 45(a)(l), prohibits engaging in "[u]nfair methods of 
competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or decepti'Ve 
acts  or practices in or affecting commerce." Section 13,  15 
U.S.C. § 53(b), authorizes  the FTC to seek injunctive relief 
for section 5 violations. 

- ' 

To succeed under section 5(a), the FI'C must prove (1) that 
there was  a representation;  (2)  that  the representation  was 
likely  to  mislead  consumers;  and  (3)  that  the  misleading 
representation was material. See FTC v.  Tashman,  318  F.3d 
1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2003). 

Upon  the  establishment  of coxporate  liability,  individual 
defendants may be held liable if the FTC can show that they 
"participated directly in the practices or acts or had authority 
to control them." FI'Cv. Amy Travel Serv., Inc.J 875 F.2d 564, 
573 (7th Cir. I 989); see also, e.g., FTCv. Freecom Communs., 
Inc., 401  F.3d  1192,  1203  (lOfu Cir.2005); FTC v.  Publ'g 
Clem·ing House, Inc.,  104  F.3d  1168,  1170 (9th Cir.l997).

F.T.C. v. Ross, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012) 
2012-2 Trade Cases P7iD)75 

------·------------------------------

"Authority  to  control  the  company  can  be evidenced  by 
active  involvement in business  affairs  and the  making  of 
corporate policy, including assuming the duties of a corporate 
officer." Amy Travel,  875 F.2d at 573. In addition,  the FTC 
must show that the individual had some knowledge  of the 
violative conduct.  See Publ'g Clearing House.  104 F.3d at 
1170 (noting th.at corporate individuals are liable if they "had 
knowledge that the corporation or one of its agents engaged in 
dishonest or fraudulent conduct, that the  misrepresentations 
were the type which a reasonable and prudent person would 
rely,  and that  consumer  injury  resulted").  In  this  regard 
the  FTC  need  not  make  a  showing  of "intent per se"(cid:173)
instead  the  knowledge  requirement  may  be  "fulfilled  by 
showing that the individual had actual knowledge of material 
misrepresentations, reckless indifference to the truth or falsity 
of such  misrepresentations,  or  an  awareness  of  a  high 
probability of fraud along with an intentional avoidance of the 
truth! t• Amy  Travel, 875 F.2d at 574 (quoting FTCv. Kitco 
of Nev.,  Inc.,  612 F.Supp.  1282, 1292 (D.Minn.l985)); see 
also FTC v. Direct M.ktg.  Concepts, Inc., 569 F.Supp.2d 285, 
311  (D.Mass.2008)  (noting that the FTC  must prove "that 
the individual defendants either knew or should have known 
about the deceptive practices, hut it is not required to prove 
subjective intent to defraud''· 

The  crux  of the  FTC's  case  against  the  sole  remaining 
Defendant Kristy Ross  is  based  on  its  contention that she 
exercised significant control over, and had knowledge of, the 
company's illegal activities. As Ross does not contest much 
of the FTC's evidence regarding the other defendants' alleged 
violations of the FTC Act,  this  Court will assume arguendo 
that FTC Act violations did indeed occur and will concentrate 
on the parties'  arguments  pertaining  to  Ross'  involvement 
with Innovative Marketing. 

*4  As a prelim.inacy matter, it must be noted that the FTC 
has clearly been able to compile a substantial and impressive 
amount of evidence  in this  case.  Because tills  case  is  set 
for  a bench  trial,  tills  Court will be the  finder  of fact,  and 
will, in all1ikelihood, review much the same evidence and 
argument at trial Given this, it would appear that the expense 
of further  litigation  could  be  avoided  through  summary 
judgment However, this Court's role in evaluating evidence 
in the  context  of summary judgment is markedly  different 
than in the context of a bench trial. Judge Nickerson of this 
Court recently described the interplay betWeen the summary 
judgment and bench trial phases of a case as follows:

identified as a Vice President oflnnovative Marketing as late 
as June 21, 2008. See FTC Mem. at 51, ECF No. 186-1 and 
supporting exhibits. Ross routinely approved and requested 
payment for expenses incurred by Innovative Marketing, and 
on several occasions, used her personal credit card to pay for 
certain advertising and operating expenses. I d. In Innovative 
Marketing's  chat logs Ross  is  observed making  executive(cid:173)
type  decisions,  demanding  that  employees  fix  problems 
and follow  company procedures, and delegating Innovative

titles and roles of Officers or business records." !d. Regarding 
the Canadian Litigation documents cited extensively by the 
FTC, Ross argues that  those same affidavits and pleadings 
conclusively  show  that  she  was  not  a  control  person  or 
director  at  Innovative  Marketing.  For  example,  Daniel 
Sundin's  affidavit in the Canadian Litigation indicates  that 
Sundin  and  Sam  Jain  alone  were  the  principals  of  the 
Innovative Marketing venture, and make no mention of Ross 
being a partner or director of the company. Id at 14. Finally, 
when  Marc  D'Souza  became a  third partner at Innovative 
Marketing  in 2006, Ross  was  not  involved  in  any  of the 
decisions  regarding  the  additional  partner  or his  level  of 
compensation.Jd at 15. 

Regarding  Ross'  knowledge  of  the  decep.tive  nature 
of  Innovative  Marketing's  arlvertisements, · the  FTC  has 
argued  that  Ross  opened  fifty-four  individual  accounts 
with  MyGeek,  an  intemet  advertising company,  routinely 
communicated  with  MyGeek  regarding  complaints  that 
company received pertaining to Innovative Marketing ads, 
and routinely approved and edited the content of ads placed 
on the MyGeek network. I d.  at 53-56. In the company's chat 
logs, Ross is observed directing employees to make ads more 
aggressive because "aggression zero doesnt [sic) give sales."

For example, Ross notes that at the time Innovative Marketing 
was fonned by Sam Jain and Daniel  Sundin in 2002, Ross 
was twenty-two years old and was dating Sam Jain. See Ross 
Mem. at 2, ECF No. 199 and supporting exhibits. She argues 
that the  FTC's  evidence  pertaining  to  her  corporate  titles 
with Innovative Marketing is essentially meaningless insofar 
as Innovative Marketing  did not  operate under traditional 
corporate  formalities,  and  the  titles  given  to  employees 
were  used  only  to  explain  employees'  responsibilities  to 
overseas  employees.  ld.  In this  regard,  Ross  points  to  a 
declaration  made by one of the  FTC's  own  investigators 
that states:  "Innovative  Marketing,  Inc.  did not adhere  to 
corporate formalities  with respect to business structure, the 

*6  Sinii.larly, Ross notes that while certain ofth.e company's 
chat logs indicate that sbe bad some degree of control over 
certain  aspects  of Innovative Marketing's  affairs,  the  vast 
majority of those same logs show that instead of approving 
ads,  Ross  merely  makes  English  language  suggestions  in 
order to assist Innovative Marketing's overseas  employees. 
I d.  at 18. Moreover, some of the chat logs, when viewed i.n 
the light most favorable to Ross, might possibly indicate that 
she actually believed Tnnovative Marketing was a legitimate 
company that provided "sound products" to its customer. Jd 
at 25- 26. In addition,  in a  2006 e-mail  exchange between 
Sam  Jain and James Reno,  a  co-defendant whom the FrC 
described  in  its  Complaint  as  a  "senior  executive,"  Reno 
writes to Jain: 

Hey  What  is  kristy's  role  in  the 
company?  How  much  access  is  she 
allowed  to  have'  And  how  much

I  need  to  know  if she's  allowed.

Jain responded: 

Yeah that should be fine.  Sudden has 
been talking to her on an off when he's 
not sick. He told  her to  remove  uru's

this conclusion; the FI'C seeks to  have this  Court draw  an 
adverse inference against Ross for continually invoking her 
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response 
to deposition questions posed, and fur failing to provide any 
meaningful discovery. However, at this stage of the litigation, 
this Court concludes that a finding of an adverse inference is 
not warranted. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment 
this Court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the 
nonmoving party and an adverse inference finding conflicts 
with  that  standard.  See,  e.g.,  Stichting  Ter  l3ehartiging 
Van  de  Bel.  V.  Schreiber,  407 F.3d  34, 55  (2d  Cir.2005); 
LaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban,  54 F.3d 387, 391 (7th 
Cir.l995) ("Treating  [the defendants')  silence  as a  separate 
piece of evidence supporting the Bank's motion for summary 
judgment and drawing inferences against [them] on the basis 
of that fact seems to be in tension with the ordinary summary 
judgment rule that all reasonable inferences must be drawn 
in favor  of the  nonmovant.");  In  re Injlight  Newspapers, 
Inc.,  423  B.R 6,  17 (Baokr.E.D.N.Y.2010)  \'the summary

has cautioned, however, that a defendant's assertion of her 
Fifth Amendment privilege can impose •~severe burdens" and 
may "significantly reduce a party's chances of prevailing on 
the merits of his claim." In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d

STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONERS ORSON SWINDLE AND  THOMAS B. LEARY 

CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART 

in ReverseAuction.com, Inc., File No. 0023046 

ReverseAuction.com, Inc., a company that offers auction services on the Internet, became 
a member of eBay, a popular Internet auction site, and was thereby granted access to the 
e-mail addresses, eBay user IDs, and feedback ratings of other eBay members. When 
registering as a member, ReverseAuction agreed to abide by eBais privacy agreement, 
whlch prohlbits members from using the personal identifying information of any eBay 
member obtained through eBay's web site for the purpose of sending unsolicited 
commercial e-mail. In Count One of the complaint, the Commission alleges that 
ReverseAuction violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by using other eBay members' user 
IDs, feedback ratings, and e-mail addresses for the purpose of sending those members 
unsolicited commercial e-mail, in contravention of its agreement with eBay. The 
complaint pleads alternative theories in support of the Section 5 violation in Count One: 
that ReverseAucti.on engaged in deception by falsely representing to eBay that it would 
abide by the privacy agreement, Complaint+ 16; or thatReverseAuction's use ofthe 
eBay member information for the purposes of sending unsolicited commercial e-mail was 
an unfair practice. Complaint + 1 7. 

We join our colleagues in support of the deception theozy in Count I. ReverseAuction 
represented to eBay that it would not use the infonnation it obtained about other members 
to send unsolicited commercial e-mail. ReverseAuction, however, sent unsolicited e-mails 
promoting its auction site to eBay members using e-mail addresses harvested from eBay's 
site. ReverseAuction thereby deceived eBay directly and, in doing so, also misled other 
members of the eBay community who believed that all participants in the eBay 
marketplace would abide by the same privacy rules. 

We recognize that the Commission's decision to proceed against the deception alleged in 
Count One could be construed as placing the Commission in the position of enforcing 
cBay's privacy policy. Nevertheless, we want to emphasize that our decision to challenge 
ReverseAuction's deception is an effort to buttress, not supplant or detract from, initiatives 
of private parties (like eBay) who develop and implement their own privacy 
arrangements. We further believe that it is in the public interest for the Commission to 
pursue the deception allegation in Count One because such deceptive conduct undermines 
consumer confidence in the nascent electronic marketplace at a critical point in time and 
may thereby inhibit its development. 

We do not, however, support the unfairness theory in Count One. The Commission has no 
authority to declare an act or practice unfair l,lil}ess it ''causes or is likely to cause 
substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers 
themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to 
competition." 15 U.S.C. + 45(n) (emphasis added). The statutory requirement of

ReverseAuction.com, Inc. - STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONERS... 

http://w'WV>'.ftc.gov/sitesfdefaultlfiles/documents/cases/2000/01/v.rww ... 

substantial injury is actually derived from the Commission's own Statement of Policy, 
issued in 1980. The Comm.ission explained at that time that, "[t]he Commission is not 
concerned with trivial or merely speculative harms. In most oases a substantial injury 
involves monetary harm ... Unwarranted health and safety risks may also support a 
finding of unfairness. Emotional impact and other more subjective types of harm, on the 
other hand, will not ordinarily make a practice unfair." Letter from the Commission to the 
Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, Commission Statement of Policy on the Scope of Consumer Unfairness 
Jurisdiction, 4 Trade Reg. Rep.(CCH) + 13,203 (Dec. 17, 1980), reprinted in 
International Harvester,  Inc., 104F.T.C. 949, 1070-76 (1984). 

We do not say that privacy concerns can never support an unfairness claim. In this case, 
however, RevrerseAuction's use of eBay members' information to send them e-mail did not 
cause substantial enough injury to meet the statutory standard. 

Consumers do not have a substantial privacy interest in the e-mail addresses and other 
information that ReverseAuction harvested since consumers had already agreed to make 
this information available to millions of other eBay members (albeit with restrictions on 
using it for commercial solicitations). Moreover, a substantial portion of this information 
is available without restriction to non-members who visit eBay's web site. Merely 
obtaining consumers' e-mail addresses without their explicit consent and sending them 
e-mail solicitations does not cause substantial injury. 

The injury in this case was caused by deception: that is, by ReverseAuction's failure io 
honor its express commitments. It is not necessary or appropriate to plead a less precise 
theory. 

Industry self-regulation and consumer preferences~ as expressed in the marketplace, are 
the best and most efficient ways to formulate privacy arrangements on the Internet and in 
commerce generally. Because p:oliferation of the kind of deceptive conduct in which 
ReverseAuction allegedly engaged could undemrine consumer confidence in such privacy 
arrangements, we believe that it is appropriate to pursue this matter under a deception 
theory. The unfairness theory~ however, posits substantial injury stemming from 
ReverseAuction's use of information readily available to millions of eBay members to 
send commercial e-mail. This standard for substantial injury overstates the appropriate 
level of government-enforced privacy protection on the Internet, and provides no rationale 
for when unsolicited commercial e-mail is unfair and when it is not. We are troubled by 
the possibility of an expansive and unwarrante-d use of the unfairness doctrine. 

For the reasons discussed above, we dissent fr{)m the unfairness allegation contained in 
Paragraph 17 of the Complaint.
