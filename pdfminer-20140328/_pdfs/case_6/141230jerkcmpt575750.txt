ORDER GRANTING MOTION OF RESPONDENT JERK, LLC, FOR EXTENSION OF 

TIME TO RESPOND TO COURT'S ORDER OF DECEMBER 22, 2014 

On December 29, 2014, Respondent Jerk, LLC ("Jerk"), filed a Motion for Extension of 

Time to Respond to the Order issued in this case on December 22, 2014 ("Motion").  Federal Trade 
Commission ("FTC") Complaint Counsel filed  an opposition to the Motion on December 30, 2014 
('"Opposition"").  As explained below, the Motion is GRANTED. 

The Order of December 22,2014 (December 22 Order) denied without prejudice Jerk's 

December 9, 2014 Motion to Extend Time to Answer Requests for Admissions.  The December 22 
Order stated: '·Jerk may, no later than December 29, 2014, renew its motion, and the request for 
relief will be reconsidered upon showing, in addition to any other requirements under 3.32(c): (1)  an 
explanation for the delay in Jerk's obtaining new counsel, including all reasons therefor; and (2) an 
offer and detailed plan to promptly comply with the orders of August 15 and November 25, 2014.'" 
December 22 Order at 3.  Jerk seeks a seven-day extension of the foregoing deadline to January 5, 
2015. 

As reasons for an extension of the deadline under the December 22 Order, Jerk cites the 

December holidays and the fact that the Commission has rescheduled the evidentiary hearing in this 
matter from January 27,2015 to March 23,2015.  Complaint Counsel responds that the December 
holidays and revised hearing date do not constitute good cause for the requested extension; that Jerk 
has demonstrated dilatory conduct in this proceeding; and that Jerk should not be rewarded for this 
conduct with additional extensions of time. 

FTC Rule 4.3(b)(l) provides that .. [f]or good cause shown, the Administrative Law Judge 

may, in any proceeding before him or her:  (1) Extend any time limit prescribed or allowed by order 
ofthe Administrative Law Judge ... : ·  16 C.F.R.  § 4.3(b)(l).  Having fully considered the parties' 
arguments, good cause exists for the brief, seven-day extension sought by Jerk.  Accordingly, Jerk"s 
Motion is GRANTED, and it is hereby ORDERED, that Jerk shall have until January 5, 2015 to 

Aquaforest TIFF Junction Evaluation 

comply with the directives of the December 22 Order.  However, fmiher delays will not be 
tolerated, and in light ofthe delays in this matter to date, Jerk shall not receive any further 
extensions of time absent a showing of compelling circumstances. 

ORDERED:
