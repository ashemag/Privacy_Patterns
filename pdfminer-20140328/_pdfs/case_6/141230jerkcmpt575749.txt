COMPLAINT COUNSEL’S OPPOSITION TO  

RESPONDENT JERK, LLC’S MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO  
RESPOND TO THE COURT’S ORDER OF DECEMBER 22, 2014 

Despite being given a second chance by the Court, Respondent Jerk, LLC (“Jerk”) has 

continued its dilatory conduct in this case by again requesting an extension to comply with the 

Court’s orders.  On December 22, the Court issued a clear directive that “Jerk may, no later than 

December 29, 2014,” renew its motion for an extension provided that it explain its delay in 

obtaining new counsel and offer a detailed plan to promptly comply with the Court’s discovery 

orders.  Rather than obey this straightforward order, Jerk has requested an additional week to file 

a renewed motion for an extension.  Motion of Respondent Jerk, LLC, to Extend Time to Respond 

to the Court’s Order of December 22, 2014, filed December 29, 2014 (“Jerk’s Motion to Extend 

Time”).  In so doing, Jerk has failed to offer a reasonable cure for the prejudice that its 

obstructionist conduct has caused and continues to cause Complaint Counsel.  The Court should 

cease entertaining Jerk’s extension requests and deny Jerk’s motion.

I. 

LEGAL STANDARD 

 

Commission Rules provide that “[f]or good cause shown, the Administrative Law Judge 

may, in any proceeding before him or her: (1) Extend any time limit prescribed or allowed by 

order of the Administrative Law Judge . . . .”  16 C.F.R. § 4.3(b).  The Federal Rules similarly 

prescribe the “good cause” standard.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).  “To demonstrate good cause, a party 

must show that despite its diligence, the time table could not reasonably have been met.”  

Hartford v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138637, at *4 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 1, 

2011).  Failure to comply with a deadline due to a holiday is not good cause.  Ott v. Federal 

Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 535 Fed. Appx. 488, at * 2 (6th Cir. 2013) (party should have 

known that the Fourth of July was part of the deadline period).  Recognizing that trial courts 

control their dockets and that “rules are rules,” appellate courts review extension decisions for 

abuse of discretion.  See Mendez v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 900 F.2d 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1990) 

(“a district judge must often be firm in . . . demanding adherence to announced deadlines.  If he 

or she sets a reasonable due date, parties should not be allowed casually to flout it or painlessly 

to escape the foreseeable consequences of noncompliance”). 

II. 

JERK HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED GOOD CAUSE FOR ITS FAILURE 
TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S DECEMBER 22 ORDER 

Jerk asserts that it needs an additional week to comply with the Court’s December 22 

Order due to “the December holidays and the revised hearing dates.”1  Jerk’s Motion to Extend 

Time at 1.  Jerk offers no further explanation for its inability to comply with the Court’s order.  

The Court was aware of the December holidays when it issued its Order and gave Jerk a week to 

file a renewed motion.  The information that Jerk was required to provide by December 29 – an 

explanation for its delay in obtaining new counsel and a plan to promptly comply with the 
                                                 
1 Granting Jerk a one-week extension would severely prejudice Complaint Counsel, who will be 
responding to Jerk’s opposition to the summary judgment motion during the same time period.

PUBLIC 

Court’s orders – is not complicated or time-consuming to assemble.  If Jerk was serious about 

coming into compliance with the Court’s orders, it would not have violated yet another Court 

order.  It also would not have waited until the last possible moment to file a request for an 

extension.  Accordingly, Jerk has not demonstrated good cause in seeking an extension of time.  

See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 584-85 (1st Cir. 1994) 

(upholding denial of an extension because the requesting party had caused many delays to the 

proceedings and had shown little respect for the Court). 

III.  GRANTING JERK ANOTHER EXTENSION WOULD REWARD JERK’S 

DILATORY BEHAVIOR 
 

Granting the extension that Jerk now seeks would reward Jerk’s dilatory behavior in this 

action.  Jerk has provided no justification for its failure to respond to Complaint Counsel’s 

discovery.  Nor has it explained in any way why it has been unable to respond to the Court’s 

various discovery orders.  To be clear, this motion is a request to extend time to file a motion for 

relief from an earlier missed deadline.  At some point, Jerk must be held accountable for 

continuing to miss deadlines under the Scheduling Order and the orders of the Court.  O’Connell 

v. Hyatt Hotels of Puerto Rico, 357 F.3d 152, 155 (1st Cir. 2004) (“litigants cannot be permitted 

to treat a scheduling order as a ‘frivolous piece of paper idly entered, which can be cavalierly 

disregarded without peril.’”)  As Complaint Counsel has previously argued, “[t]his proceeding 

will become subsumed by countless requests to excuse Jerk’s delinquencies on other matters, 

undermining the Commission’s objective for speedy litigation.”  Complaint Counsel’s 

Opposition to Jerk’s Motion to Extend Time to Answer Complaint Counsel’s Second Request for 

Admissions (December 16, 2014), p. 5.  That is exactly what is happening here with Jerk’s latest 

request.

IV.  CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Jerk’s motion.
