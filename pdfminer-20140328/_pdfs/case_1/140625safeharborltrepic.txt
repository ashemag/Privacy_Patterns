Dear Mr. Rotenberg, Ms. Horwitz, and Ms. Barnes: 

 

 

Thank you for your comment on behalf of the Electronic Privacy Information Center 

(“EPIC”) regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (“Commission” or “FTC”) consent 
agreements in the above-entitled proceedings.  The Commission has placed your comment on the 
public record pursuant to Rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 
4.9(b)(6)(ii), and has given it serious consideration.   

In these 12 cases, the Commission alleges that Respondents violated Section 5 of the 

Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”) by misrepresenting that they were current 
participants in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework and/or U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework 
(collectively “Safe Harbor framework”) when in fact each company allowed its self-certification 
to lapse.  In addition, the proposed complaints against Apperian, Inc., Baker Tilly Virchow 
Krause, LLP, DataMotion, Inc., and the Receivable Management Services Corporation allege 
that these companies deceptively displayed the Safe Harbor Certification Mark.  The complaints 
do not allege that any Respondent committed any substantive violations of the privacy principles 
of the Safe Harbor framework. 
 

The proposed orders prohibit each company from misrepresenting the extent to which 

each is a member of, adheres to, complies with, is certified by, is endorsed by, or otherwise 
participates in any privacy or security program sponsored by the government or any other self-

regulatory or standard-setting organization, including, but not limited to, the U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework or the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework to directly address the complaint 
allegations in these cases.  The proposed orders, which terminate after 20 years, include standard 
record-keeping and service provisions, as well as requirements for each Respondent to file a 
compliance report with the Commission.   
 

These cases reflect an ongoing effort by the Commission to enforce compliance with the 

Safe Harbor framework.  The Commission brought 10 previous cases against companies for 
misrepresentations related to Safe Harbor.  From late 2009 through early 2010, the Commission 
brought a series of cases against six companies that violated Section 5 by falsely representing on 
their websites that they held current self-certifications to the Safe Harbor Framework.1  In 
addition, in 2011, the Commission’s action against Balls of Kryptonite included a count alleging 
the respondent violated Section 5 by misrepresenting its status with Safe Harbor.2  Finally, the 
FTC has brought Section 5 cases against Google, Facebook and Myspace that included counts 
relating to substantive noncompliance with the Safe Harbor principles.3 
 

Your comment notes EPIC’s support of the 12 proposed consent orders but urges the 
Commission to make a number of revisions to the orders.  Specifically, you request that the 
Commission:  (1) require Respondents to comply with the President’s Consumer Privacy Bill of 
Rights; (2) publish the Respondents’ compliance reports; and (3) strengthen the sanctions against 
respondent DDC Laboratories, specifically.   
 

Your comment recommends that the Commission require Respondents to conform to the 

substantive protections of the President’s Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights (“CPBR”).  The 
Commission supports the goals laid out in the CPBR and highlighted a number of these 
principles in our March 2012 Privacy Report, “Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid

Change: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers.”4  However, the order is designed 
to address specific conduct as alleged in the complaint—which did not include substantive 
violations of the Safe Harbor framework—not to impose obligations that may not be tied to such 
conduct. 
 

Your comment further urges the Commission to make Respondents’ compliance reports 

publicly available.  As the Commission has stated with regard to the third-party assessments 
required by many of our privacy and data security orders, there is a public benefit to providing 
transparency regarding a company’s compliance with an FTC order.  The public may seek access 
to compliance reports required by the orders by making a request under the Freedom of 
Information Act.5  If the compliance reports contain any trade secrets or other confidential 
commercial or financial information, or information about consumers or other third parties, the 
Commission is prohibited from disclosing that information.6  Upon receipt of a request for 
confidential treatment of all or part of the compliance report, the Commission will conduct a 
careful review to determine whether confidential treatment is warranted.  We will make every 
effort to be transparent regarding the compliance reports, consistent with the applicable law.  If 
the Commission determines that a report has been frequently requested, the agency will post 
such portions as may be released to the public on the FTC’s website. 
 

Moreover, you request that the Commission strengthen the sanctions against DDC 

Laboratories (“DDC”) due to the type of consumer data that DDC collects and the fact that “[b]y 
misrepresenting its compliance with privacy standards, DDC Labs puts highly sensitive, 
extremely intimate personal data at risk.”  It is important to reiterate that the proposed complaint 
against DDC alleges that the company misrepresented that it was a current participant in the Safe 
Harbor framework, when, in fact, its self-certification had lapsed.  There was no allegation that 
DDC substantively violated any of the privacy principles of the Safe Harbor framework or that 
personal data was at risk.  The proposed orders in all 12 cases include fencing-in relief that 
enjoins the companies from making such misrepresentations in the future.  If they do, or if 
Respondents violate any other term of the final order, they could be liable for civil monetary 
penalties of up to $16,000 per violation, or up to $16,000 per day in the case of continuing 
violations (as provided by Section 5(l) of the FTC Act).  Thus, the order has the effect of 
requiring the company to abide by the substantive Safe Harbor principles for as long as it 
chooses to represent that it complies with the Safe Harbor Framework.  In addition, if one of the 
Respondent companies chooses to leave Safe Harbor, it must continue to apply the Safe Harbor 
principles to the covered data it collected while participating in the program for as long as it 
stores, uses, or discloses that data.  Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposed 
order appropriately addresses the conduct at issue in this case.

Finally, you reference past comments that EPIC has submitted to the Commission 

 
regarding other settlements and state that the Commission’s failure to implement your proposed 
changes is:  “(1) contrary to the explicit purpose of the statutory provision that allows the 
Commission to request comments from the public; (2) contrary to the broader purpose of the 
Commission to police unfair and deceptive trade practices; and (3) contrary to the interests of 
American consumers.” (EPIC Comment at 4, references omitted).  The Commission Rules of 
Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 2.34, do not require that the Commission accept proposed changes filed by 
commenters.  Rather, the applicable Rule of Practice directs the Commission to receive and 
consider any “comments or views” concerning the order that may be filed by “any interested 
person,” and states that, thereafter, the Commission may “withdraw its acceptance of the 
agreement . . . [and] take such other action as it may consider appropriate.”  The Commission 
carefully considers, and has a practice of responding to, public comments filed in reference to its 
administrative settlements.  But only when the Commission determines that the public interest 
would be best served by amending the consent order does the Commission take such action, 
which requires the consent of the respondent.  There have been such modifications in a number 
of matters.7  Where the Commission seeks a modification to which the respondent does not 
agree, the Commission may proceed to litigation, where a court will ultimately determine what 
relief is warranted under the FTC Act or other applicable law.  In this case and others in which 
the Commission has not sought to modify a proposed consent order as recommended by EPIC or 
another commenter, it is because the Commission has concluded that the public interest is best 
served by final adoption of the original order. 

In light of the considerations discussed above, the Commission has determined that the 

 
public interest would best be served by issuing the Decision and Orders in the above-titled 
proceedings in final form without any modifications.  The final Decision and Orders and other
