Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To 
Aid Public Comment 

The Federal Trade Commission 

(‘‘FTC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) has accepted, 
subject to final approval, a consent 
agreement applicable to PDB Sports, 
Ltd., doing business as the Denver 
Broncos Football Club (‘‘the Denver 
Broncos’’). 

The proposed consent order has been 

placed on the public record for thirty 
(30) days for receipt of comments by 
interested persons. Comments received 
during this period will become part of 
the public record. After thirty (30) days, 
the Commission will again review the 
agreement and the comments received, 
and will decide whether it should 
withdraw from the agreement and take 
appropriate action or make final the 
agreement’s proposed order. 

This matter concerns alleged false or 

misleading representations that the 
Denver Broncos made to consumers 
concerning their participation in the

Federal  Register / Vol.  79,  No.  19 / Wednesday,  January  29,  2014 / Notices 

Safe Harbor privacy framework (‘‘Safe 
Harbor’’) agreed upon by the U.S. and 
the European Union (‘‘EU’’) (‘‘U.S.-EU 
Safe Harbor Framework’’). It is among 
several actions the Commission is 
bringing to enforce the promises that 
companies make when they certify that 
they participate in the Safe Harbor 
Framework. The Safe Harbor framework 
allows U.S. companies to transfer data 
outside the EU consistent with 
European law. To join the Safe Harbor 
framework, a company must self-certify 
to the U.S. Department of Commerce 
(‘‘Commerce’’) that it complies with a 
set of principles and related 
requirements that have been deemed by 
the European Commission as providing 
‘‘adequate’’ privacy protection. 
Commerce maintains a public Web site, 
www.export.gov/safeharbor, where it 
posts the names of companies that have 
self-certified to the Safe Harbor 
framework. The listing of companies 
indicates whether their self-certification 
is ‘‘current’’ or ‘‘not current.’’ 
Companies are required to re-certify 
every year in order to retain their status 
as ‘‘current’’ members of the Safe Harbor 
framework. 

The Denver Broncos are a professional 

football team and a member of the 
National Football League. According to 
the Commission’s complaint, from 
November 2008 until November 2013, 
the Denver Broncos set forth on their 
Web site, www.denverbroncos.com, 
privacy policies and statements about 
their practices, including statements 
related to their participation in the U.S.- 
EU Safe Harbor Framework. 

The Commission’s complaint alleges 

that the Denver Broncos falsely 
represented that they were a ‘‘current’’ 
participant in the Safe Harbor when, in 
fact, from November 2011 until 
November 2013, the Denver Broncos 
were not a ‘‘current’’ participant in the 
U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. The 
Commission’s complaint alleges that in 
November 2008, the Denver Broncos 
submitted a Safe Harbor self- 
certification. The Denver Broncos did 
not renew the self-certification in 
November 2011, and Commerce 
subsequently updated the Denver 
Broncos’ status to ‘‘not current’’ on its 
public Web site. 

Part I of the proposed order prohibits 

the Denver Broncos from making 
misrepresentations about their 
membership in any privacy or security 
program sponsored by the government 
or any other self-regulatory or standard- 
setting organization, including, but not 
limited to, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor 
Framework. 

Parts II through VI of the proposed 

order are reporting and compliance 

provisions. Part II requires the Denver 
Broncos to retain documents relating to 
compliance with the order for a five- 
year period. Part III requires 
dissemination of the order now and in 
the future to persons with 
responsibilities relating to the subject 
matter of the order. Part IV ensures 
notification to the FTC of changes in 
corporate status. Part V mandates that 
the Denver Broncos submit an initial 
compliance report to the FTC, and make 
available to the FTC subsequent reports. 
Part VI is a provision ‘‘sunsetting’’ the 
order after twenty (20) years, with 
certain exceptions. 

The purpose of this analysis is to 

facilitate public comment on the 
proposed order. It is not intended to 
constitute an official interpretation of 
the proposed complaint or order or to 
modify the order’s terms in any way. 

By direction of the Commission.

Secretary.
