Dear Mr. Gellman: 

 

 

Thank you for your comment regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s (“Commission” 

or “FTC”) consent agreements in the above-entitled proceedings.  The Commission has placed 
your comment on the public record pursuant to Rule 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice, 16 C.F.R. § 4.9(b)(6)(ii), and has given it serious consideration.   

In your comment, you urge the Commission not to accept these consent orders and 
express concern that:  1) the complaints lack detail; 2) the Commission did not assess the 
companies’ compliance with the substantive Safe Harbor privacy requirements; 3) the consent 
orders are too narrow and do not provide adequate relief or deterrent effect; and 4) the 
Commission’s commitment to enforcing the Safe Harbor framework is not the most efficient use 
of its resources.     
 

Your comment states “there are virtually no facts in the complaint or consent decree that 

would enable the public to evaluate the extent of the misrepresentation.”  We respectfully 
disagree.  The complaints provide the necessary information to support the law violations 
alleged.  These complaints contain a single allegation that Respondents engaged in deceptive 
practices by falsely representing, either expressly or by implication, that they were current 
participants in the Safe Harbor framework, when, in fact, each company had allowed its self-

certification to lapse.1  To support this allegation, the complaints explicitly recite the 
misrepresentations Respondents made and the length of time that each Respondent made the 
false representations.  The proposed complaints do not allege that Respondents substantively 
violated any of the privacy principles of the Safe Harbor framework or that personal data was at 
risk.   
 

These cases demonstrate that the Commission takes seriously misrepresentations about 
membership in the Safe Harbor.  However, the Commission is also interested in ensuring that 
companies abide by the substantive Safe Harbor promises they make.  As a matter of course, the 
Commission’s privacy investigations under Section 5 of the FTC Act of companies that claim 
Safe Harbor membership include evaluating the companies’ substantive practices.  The 
Commission has brought several cases with counts relating to substantive violations of the Safe 
Harbor.2    
 

Your comment also objects to the “extraordinarily narrow scope” of the proposed orders 

and specifically complains that the proposed orders do not require Respondents to remain 
members of the Safe Harbor framework in the future.  As you know, the Safe Harbor framework 
is a voluntary program.  Requiring Respondents to maintain Safe Harbor membership would be 
problematic for a couple of reasons.  First, it is unclear under what authority the Commission 
could require Respondents to continue membership in the Safe Harbor.  Second, there are many 
legitimate reasons that a company could decide it no longer wishes to participate in the Safe 
Harbor framework (e.g., the business no longer needs to transfer data from the EU and 
Switzerland to the U.S.), and it would be inappropriate to require it to maintain a membership.   
The orders prohibit Respondents from misrepresenting the extent to which each is a member of, 
adheres to, complies with, is certified by, is endorsed by, or otherwise participates in any privacy 
or security program sponsored by the government or any other self-regulatory or standard-setting 
organization, including, but not limited to, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework or the U.S.-
Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.  Should the companies claim to abide by the Safe Harbor but not 
abide with its underlying principles, they could be violating the terms of the orders and be liable 
for civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation, or up to $16,000 per day in the case of 
continuing violations (as provided by Section 5(l) of the FTC Act).  Thus, the orders have the 
effect of requiring the companies to abide by the substantive Safe Harbor principles for as long 
as they choose to represent that they comply with the Safe Harbor Framework.  It is important to 
note that companies that choose to leave the Safe Harbor must continue to apply the Safe Harbor 
principles to the covered data they collected while participating in the program for as long as 
they store, use, or disclose that data.  The Commission believes that the orders in these matters 
are appropriate to adequately address the violations at issue and to provide fencing-in relief.     
                                                 
1 In addition, the proposed complaints against Apperian, Inc., Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, DataMotion, Inc., 
and the Receivable Management Services Corporation also allege that these companies deceptively display the Safe 
Harbor Certification Mark.

As you point out in your comment, the Commission does a remarkable amount of work 
with relatively limited resources.  We are a small agency with a broad mandate.  Enforcement of 
the Safe Harbor framework is an important component of the Commission’s mission.  We 
believe that it is important to hold companies to the promises they make.  That said, Safe Harbor 
enforcement is only one component of a robust agenda that includes cases in the areas of data 
security, mobile privacy, behavioral advertising, credit reporting, social networking, children’s 
privacy, financial privacy, health privacy, and data brokers.3  We agree that we should focus our 
efforts on all of these areas.   
 
 
Finally, your comment alleges that the Commission does not “consider seriously public 
comments.”  We respectfully disagree.  The Commission carefully considers, and has a practice 
of responding to, public comments filed in reference to its administrative settlements.  When the 
Commission determines that the public interest would be best served by amending a consent 
order in response to a public comment or otherwise, the Commission takes such action, as it has 
done in a number of matters.4  Where the Commission seeks a modification to which the 
respondent does not agree, the Commission may proceed to litigation, where a court will 
ultimately determine what relief is warranted under the FTC Act or other applicable law.  In this 
case and others in which the Commission has not sought to modify a proposed consent order as 
recommended by you or another commenter, it is because the Commission has concluded that 
the public interest is best served by final adoption of the original order.  

In light of the considerations discussed above, the Commission has determined that the 

 
public interest would best be served by issuing the Decision and Orders in the above-titled
