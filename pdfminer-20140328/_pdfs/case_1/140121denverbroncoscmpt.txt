DOCKET NO. C- 

COMPLAINT 

 
  
The Federal Trade Commission, having reason to believe that PDB Sport, Ltd., doing 
business as the Denver Broncos Football Club, a limited partnership, has violated the Federal 
Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), and it appearing to the Commission that this proceeding is 
in the public interest, alleges: 
 
1.  Respondent PDB Sport, Ltd., doing business as the Denver Broncos Football Club, (“Denver 

Broncos”) is a Colorado limited partnership with its principal office or place of business at 
13655 Broncos Parkway, Englewood, CO 80112.  
 

2.  Respondent is a professional football team and a member of the National Football League. 
 
3.  The acts and practices of respondent as alleged in this complaint have been in or affecting 

commerce, as “commerce” is defined in Section 4 of the FTC Act. 

4.  Respondent has set forth on its website, www.denverbroncos.com, privacy policies and 
statements about its practices, including statements related to its participation in the Safe 
Harbor privacy framework agreed upon by the U.S. and the European Union (“U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework”). 

 

 

The Framework 

 

5.  The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework provides a method for U.S. companies to transfer 
personal data outside of Europe that is consistent with the requirements of the European 
Union Directive on Data Protection (“Directive”).  Enacted in 1995, the Directive sets forth 
European Union (“EU”) requirements for privacy and the protection of personal data.

Among other things, it requires EU Member States to implement legislation that prohibits the 
transfer of personal data outside the EU, with exceptions, unless the European Commission 
(“EC”) has made a determination that the recipient jurisdiction’s laws ensure the protection 
of such personal data.  This determination is referred to commonly as meeting the EU’s 
“adequacy” standard. 
 

6.  To satisfy the EU adequacy standard for certain commercial transfers, the U.S. Department 
of Commerce (“Commerce”) and the EC negotiated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, 
which went into effect in 2000.  The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework allows U.S. 
companies to transfer personal data lawfully from the EU.  To join the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor 
Framework, a company must self-certify to Commerce that it complies with seven principles 
and related requirements that have been deemed to meet the EU’s adequacy standard. 

7.  Companies under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as 

the U.S. Department of Transportation, are eligible to join the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor 
Framework.  A company under the FTC’s jurisdiction that claims it has self-certified to the 
Safe Harbor principles, but failed to self-certify to Commerce, may be subject to an 
enforcement action based on the FTC’s deception authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act. 

8.  Commerce maintains a public website, www.export.gov/safeharbor, where it posts the names 
of companies that have self-certified to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework.  The listing of 
companies indicates whether their self-certification is “current” or “not current” and a date 
when recertification is due.  Companies are required to re-certify every year in order to retain 
their status as “current” members of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework.     

Violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act 

9.  In November 2008, respondent submitted to Commerce a self-certification of compliance to 

 

the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. 
 

10. In November 2011, respondent did not renew its self-certification to the U.S.-EU Safe 
Harbor Framework, and Commerce subsequently updated respondent’s status to “not 
current” on its public website.  

 
11. From at least November 2008 until November 2013,  respondent disseminated or caused to 
be disseminated privacy policies and statements on the www.denverbroncos.com website, 
including, but not limited to, the following statements: 

 

 

 

 

 

Denver Broncos Football Club complies with the EU Safe Harbor 
framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding 
the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

12. Through the means described in Paragraph 11, respondent represented, expressly or by 
implication, that it was a “current” participant in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework.

13. In truth and in fact, from November 2011 until November 2013, respondent was not a 

“current” participant in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework.  Therefore, the representation 
set forth in Paragraph 12 is false and misleading. 
 

14. The acts and practices of respondent as alleged in this complaint constitute deceptive acts or 

practices, in or affecting commerce, in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act. 

THEREFORE, the Federal Trade Commission this ____________ day of _________, 2014, 

has issued this complaint against respondent. 
 
            By the Commission.
