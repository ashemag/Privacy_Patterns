Therefore,

that: 
 
1. 

IT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between PDB Sports, Ltd., d/b/a the Denver Broncos 

Proposed respondent is a Colorado limited partnership with its principal office or place of 
business at 13655 Broncos Parkway, Englewood, CO 80112.

complaint, except as specifically stated in this order.  Only for purposes of this action, 
proposed respondent admits the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction. 

Proposed respondent waives: 

A. 

B. 

C. 

any further procedural steps; 

the requirement that the Commission’s decision contain a statement of findings of 
fact and conclusions of law; and 

all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity 
of the order entered pursuant to this agreement. 

This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and 
until it is accepted by the Commission.  If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, 
it, together with the draft complaint, will be placed on the public record for a period of 
thirty (30) days and information about it publicly released.  The Commission thereafter

in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve 
its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition 
of the proceeding. 

This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such 
acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions 
of Section 2.34 of the Commission’s Rules, the Commission may, without further notice 
to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with 
the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order in disposition 
of the proceeding, and (2) make information about it public.  When so entered, the order 
shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the 
same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders.  The order 
shall become final upon service.  Delivery of the complaint and the decision and order to 
proposed respondent’s address as stated in this agreement by any means specified in 
Section 4.4(a) of the Commission’s Rules shall constitute service.  Proposed respondent 
waives any right it may have to any other manner of service.  The complaint may be used 
in construing the terms of the order.  No agreement, understanding, representation, or 
interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or 
contradict the terms of the order. 

Proposed respondent has read the draft complaint and consent order.  Proposed 
respondent understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by 
law and other appropriate relief for each violation of the order after it becomes final.
